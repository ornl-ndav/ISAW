	The Wizards are meant as a tool to bridge the gap between analyzing data
	using the ISAW program, which is a fully flexible analysis, and analyzing
	data using scripts, which are fast but only run sequentially.<br><br>
	The Wizards allow you to perform predetermined steps one at a time, view
	intermediate results, and go back to change and/or optimize inputs in a
	previous step.

	<font size=+3>Starting the SCD Wizards</font>
	</center>
	<hr>
	The ISAW Wizards are not yet available from the main ISAW program.  You must
	open a command prompt in order to run the wizards.  In addition, 
	your classpath must be properly set up in order to run the Wizards.  If you
	are running a downloaded version of ISAW, your classpath should be set
	correctly already.  If you are using source from CVS or your classpath is not
	set, you must set your classpath so that it includes the directory that you 
	put the source code into.  You can also specify the classpath directly when
	running the Wizards.  If you need to specify the classpath directly, you will
	need to enter the full path to the ISAW installation directory (we will
	denote this as ${ISAW_HOME}).<br><br>
	To run the Wizards, type<br><br><code>
	java Wizard.TOF_SCD.InitialPeaksWizard</code><br><br>
	for the Initial Peaks Wizard, or<br><br><code>
	java Wizard.TOF_SCD.DailyPeaksWizard</code><br><br>
	for the Daily Peaks Wizard.  If these do not work for you, it is likely that
	your classpath is incorrectly set.  A temporary fix is to specify the
	classpath directly:<br><br><code>
	java -cp $CLASSPATH:${ISAW_HOME} Wizard.TOF_SCD.InitialPeaksWizard</code><br><br>
	for the Initial Peaks Wizard, or<br><br><code>
	java -cp $CLASSPATH:${ISAW_HOME} Wizard.TOF_SCD.DailyPeaksWizard</code><br><br>
	for the Daily Peaks Wizard.

	<font size=+3>General use of the Wizards</font>
	</center>
	<hr>
	There are several ways to navigate through the Wizards.  The double arrow
	buttons move to the first step or the last step and the single arrows move
	one step forward or backward.<br><br>
	To execute an intermediate step, you can click on the "Do" button, and to
	execute all steps, you can click on the "Do All" button.  To view the results
	and parameters of the intermediate steps, you can select "View" from the menu
	bar then select the parameter you want to view.<br><br>
	To get help on the Wizard or a particular step, you can click on the "Help"
	option in the menu bar, then click on "On Wizard" or "On Current Form"
	respectively.<br><br>
	To save your progress, you can click on the "File" option in the menu bar,
	then click on "Save Wizard State", then type the file name that you want to
	save your progress to.  A ".wsf" extension is automatically appended to the
	name.  In a similar manner, you can load a previously saved Wizard using
	"File" then "Load Wizard State."<br><br>
	Clicking on "Reset" or "Reset All" will clear the progress bar for the
	current step or all steps, respectively.  This allows you to rerun one or
	more steps without changing any parameters.<br><br>
	To set a working or projects directory, select "Projects Directory" from the
	wizard menu, then simply select the directory you want.  The projects directory 
	will coerce the file browsers to initially open to your selected directory.

	<font size=+3>SCD Initial Peaks Wizard</font>
	</center>
	<hr>
	This Wizard is meant to be used for an initial run to establish a baseline
	for further runs on the same sample.  There are six steps in this Wizard:<br>
	<ol>
		<li>Finding peaks</li>
		<li>Establishing an initial "blind" orientation matrix</li>
		<li>Indexing the peaks</li>
		<li>Finding crystal geometry</li>
		<li>Refining the orientation matrix with a least squares routine.</li>
		<li>Reindexing peaks using the refined orientation matrix</li>
	</ol>
	The last step is optional, although typically multiple iterations are done
	over steps 5 and 6.

	<hr>

	<ol>
		<li>
		<font size=+1>Finding Peaks</font><br><br>
		Here is a screenshot of step 1 of the Wizard:<br><br>
		<img src="images/IPForm1.jpg"><br><br>
		This step is used to find peaks from a single run using several parameters.
		The result is a peaks file.
		<br><br>Its parameters are:<br>
		<ol>
			<li>Raw data path: This is the directory the runfiles are in (e.g.
			C:\\ISAW\SampleRuns).  If you are using the Browse button to find this
			directory, you must highlight the directory you want rather than going
			into the directory.</li>
			<li>Output data path: This is the directory you want the resultant output
			to go to.</li>
			<li>Run numbers: Here is where you enter the run number you want to
			analyze.  For example, if you are analyzing SCD06497.RUN, you would enter
			06497 or 6497 here.</li>
			<li>Experiment name: This is the name of your experiment (e.g. quartz).
			Note that this name will be used for the peaks file naming (e.g.
			quartz.peaks).</li>
			<li>Maximum number of peaks: This is the maximum number of peaks you want
			listed in the peaks file.</li>
			<li>Minimum peak intensity: The minimum intensity that a peak should have
			to be included in a file.</li>
			<li>Append data to file: If you have an existing peaks file that you wish
			this analysis to be appended to, check this box.  In order for this to
			work, the peaks file must be named, for example, quartz.peaks if your
			experiment name is quartz.  If the file does not exist, you will get an
			error.</li>
			<li>SCD calibration file line to use: this is the line of the specified
			calibration file to use for this analysis.  Putting a -1 here will select
			the most recent data.</li>
			<li>SCD calibration file: This is the fully qualified name of the 
			calibration file to use (e.g. C:\\ISAW\SampleRuns\instprm.dat).
			</li>
			<li>Pixel rows and columns to keep: This is the range of values of the
			detector pixel information to keep.  Note that a square detector is
			assumed, so if you have a 100 x 100 pixel detector, and you want to
			remove 10 pixels on each side (due to noise, etc.), you would put 10:90
			in this field.</li>
		</ol>
		</li><br>

		<li>
		<font size=+1>Establishing an initial orientation matrix</font><br><br>
		Here is a screenshot of step 2 of the Wizard:<br><br>
		<img src="images/IPForm2.jpg"><br><br>
		This step is used to find an initial orientation matrix for this data.  Its
		output is the log file from BlindJ as well as an orientation matrix.
		<br><br>Its parameters are:<br>
		<ol>
			<li>Peak sequence numbers: These are the sequence numbers that you have
			selected after viewing the peaks file (click on the View option in the
			menus to view the peaks file).  In general, these will be the peaks with
			the highest intensity.</li>
			<li>Matrix file: this is the fully qualified name of the file that you
			want the orientation matrix written to.  You do not need to append a .mat
			extension to the file name as it is done automatically.  You may append
			it if you wish, as the Wizard can handle it either way.</li>
		</ol>
		</li><br>

		<li>
		<font size=+1>Indexing the peaks</font><br><br>
		Here is a screenshot of step 3 of the Wizard:<br><br>
		<img src="images/IPForm3.jpg"><br><br>
		This step is where you will index the peaks that were found in step 1.  
		Its output is the file index.log.
		<br><br>Its parameters are:<br>
		<ol>
			<li>Restrict runs: In general you will not need to worry about this for
			this Wizard.  If, however, you are analyzing multiple runs and you only
			want to index one of the runs, you would enter the run number here.
			Leaving this blank selects all runs.</li>
			<li>Delta h: This is the allowable h uncertainty</li>
			<li>Delta k: This is the allowable k uncertainty</li>
			<li>Delta l: This is the allowable l uncertainty</li>
			<li>Update peaks file: checking this box will update the peaks file with
			the indexing information.</li>
			<li>Append to log file: If this option is unchecked, any existing
			index.log file in the output data path will be overwritten.  To append
			the index results to an existing log file, check this box.</li>
		</ol>
		</li><br>

		<li>
		<font size=+1>Finding crystal geometry</font><br><br>
		Here is a screenshot of step 4 of the Wizard:<br><br>
		<img src="images/IPForm4.jpg"><br><br>
		Here is where you will select a crystal geometry.  Its output is
		scalar.log.
		<br><br>Its parameters are:<br>
		<ol>
			<li>Delta: ?????? </li>
			<li>Symmetry constraints: restrictions on the resulting symmetry (e.g.
			P-cubic, I-cubic, etc.).</li>
		</ol>
		</li><br>

		<li>
		<font size=+1>Refining the orientation matrix</font><br><br>
		Here is a screenshot of step 5 of the Wizard:<br><br>
		<img src="images/IPForm5.jpg"><br><br>
		This step is where you will refine the initial orientation matrix based on
		the results of indexing the peaks and the crystal geometry.  Its output is
		the lsqrsj.log file and a refined orientation matrix.
		<br><br>Its parameters are:<br>
		<ol>
			<li>Restrict runs: In general you will not need to worry about this for
			this Wizard.  If, however, you are analyzing multiple runs and you only
			want to refine the matrix based on  one of the runs, you would enter 
			the run number here.  Leaving this blank selects all runs.</li>
			<li>Restrict sequence numbers: These are the sequence numbers that you
			want to restrict the refinement to.</li>
			<li>Transform matrix: This is the matrix for the crystal geometry you
			found in step 4.  If you want to view this file, click on the left arrow
			button and go to the View menu.</li>
			<li>Matrix file: this is the fully qualified name of the file that you
			want the orientation matrix written to.  You do not need to append a .mat
			extension to the file name as it is done automatically.  You may append
			it if you wish, as the Wizard can handle it either way.</li>
			<li>Minimum peak intensity threshold: The minimum intensity that a peak 
			should have to be included in the refinement.</li>
			<li>Pixel rows and columns to keep: This is the range of values of the
			detector pixel information to keep.  Note that a square detector is
			assumed, so if you have a 100 x 100 pixel detector, and you want to
			remove 10 pixels on each side (due to noise, etc.), you would put 10:90
			in this field.</li>
		</ol>
		</li><br>

		<li>
		<font size=+1>Reindexing the peaks</font><br><br>
		Here is a screenshot of step 6 of the Wizard:<br><br>
		<img src="images/IPForm6.jpg"><br><br>
		This step is optional.  Here is where you will use the refined orientation
		matrix from step 5 to reindex the peaks.  It is similar in every manner to
		step 3, except that you can now specify what matrix file you want to use.
		</li>
