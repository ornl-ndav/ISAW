  <ul>
   <li> Comment lines MUST start(1st character) with a # symbol or the letters REM
   <li> Parameter lines MUST start with a $ symbol
   <li> <ul> All other Lines
        <li> Can start with or end with as many spaces as desired
        <LI> Must not start with a # or $
        <LI> Can continue to the next line using _, the underscore character,
             as the last character on the line
        <LI> Represent blank lines or executable statements
        <li> There is only one executable statement per line( or continued line)
        <li> Spaces outside of quotes are delimiters for variable names,
             Command names, etc.

 <A name="Data Types">Data Types</a><ul>
   <ul> The Data Types "Fully" Supported are
     <li> Integer
     <li> Float
     <li> Boolean(Logical)
     <li> DataSet
     <li> Array (This is Java's Vector Data Type)
   </ul>
   Supported means that variables can store data of this type, expressions using
      operations like +, -, *, /, ^, AND, OR, NOT evaluate correctly, and data of 
     this type can be used as arguments in the operators.<P>

  NOTE: Arrays are Really Vectors.  Elements need not be of the same data type. <P>

  <UL>There is some support for Objects
    <LI> Elements of an Array can be arbitrary objects.<BR>
        NOTE: A[3]= X  saves a REFERENCE to X in A[3]
    <LI> Arguments of the operators can be any Object Data Type
    <LI> Only array elements can store these variables, and there are no intrinsic
         operations that can be applied to these variables.  Operators can always be
         written to act on specific types of Objects.
  </ul>

   </ul>

<A name="Constants">Constants</a><ul>
  <ul> Examples
     <li> Integer :  4,  -3      Contain no Decimal point
     <li> Float   :  5.  2.0     Contain a decimal point
     <li> Boolean(Logical):  True  false     Not case sensitive
     <li> DataSet        None yet
     <li> Array : [3, true, "abc"] or [ [1,2,3],[3,4,5]]  or [1:5,8]
   </ul>
<ul>
   The <b>NULL</b> Constant:<P>
     Assigning a variable the NULL value will delete it from the scripting language's namespace,
     if it is not a parameter.  This is used to eliminate references to large datasets and hence free
     up space.
 </ul>

<P><P>
<A name="Variables">Variables</a><ul>
    The names for variables are any sequence of characters on one line between two delimiters.  The
   delimiters include  spaces, tabs, square and round braces, algebraic and string operations, comma,
   colon, inequality and equality symbols and quotes.<P><P>

   The Data Type of a variable is "declared" by the first value assigned to it.

</ul>
   
<P><P>
<A name="Parameters">Parameters</a><ul>
  Parameters for a script are declared using lines starting with a $ symbol as the first character.<P>
  The format is as follows:<P>
  <Center> $Varname  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    DataType(InitValue)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Prompt</Center>
 <P> Varname is the varible name used in the script to refer to this variable<P>
  The Initial value( and corresponding parenthesis ) are not necessary<P>

 <A name="Programming Structures">Programming Structures</a><ul>
    There are Three programming structures so far:<P>
     <A href="#For">For loops</a>, <A href="#If"> If then structures</a>,  and 
       <A href="#Err">On error structures</a><P>
    Nesting of these structures is supported<P>

   <A name="For">For loops</a><ul>
     
     A FOR Block starts with :  For <B>var</B> in <B>X</B><BR><UL>
     where <B>X</b> represents an Array variable or constant<BR>
     and <b>var</B> represents a variable that is not an element of an array. It must have
      the proper data type to be assigned all the elements in the array.
     </ul>

     A FOR Block ends with:  endfor<P>


    The keywords for, in , and endfor are NOT case sensitive
   </ul><P><P>
   <A name="If"> If structures</a><ul>
    All If structures starts with:  <U>if</U>  logical_expression<BR>
      It can also start with: <U>if</U>  logical_expression <U>then</U><BR><P>

    All If structures end with: <U>endif</U><P>

    An If-Then-Else structure  contain exactly one <U> else</u> statement between the beginning and
      the end<P>

    An If-Then-Elseif structure contains one or more of the following statments between 
         the beginning and the end  of this if structure:<ul>
       <li><u>elseif</u> logical_expression
       <li> <u>elseif</u> logical_expression <u>then</u>
       <LI>  <u>else</u> <BR>
           There MUST be no elseif statements below this one to the end of the if structure
        </ul>
       
   </ul><P><P>
   <A name="Err">On error structures</a><ul>
    An OnError Block starts with:<u>On Error</u><P>

    An OnError Block ends with: <U>end error</u><P>

    An OnError Block MAY have at most one <u>else error</u> statement between the start and the end.<P><P>

    If an error occurs in the first block of code in an on error block, the next statement executed 
     will be the first statement after the else error statment, if there is one, otherwise the
     first statement after the end error will be executed.
   

   </ul></ul><P>

<A name="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</a>
  The Isaw Scripting Language has three <u>Directives</u>, Command,Title, and Category.
  These are placed in the script on a line starting with a $.  They override the default
  Command name, Title( appears in menus), and Category List(describing the path in
  menus).  Examples of their format are:<ul>
   <li>$Command = HelpMe
   <li>$Title=Help Me
   <li>$Category =  Operator, Generic,TOF_SAD, Scripts
  </uL>
