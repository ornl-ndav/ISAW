 * Modified:
 *
 *  $Log$
 *  Revision 1.1  2003/12/23 01:55:51  millermi
 *  - Moved from TwoD directory to a more logical directory. Now
 *    in the same directory as the class that it provides
 *    functionality for.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2003/12/18 22:42:12  millermi
 *  - This file was involved in generalizing AxisInfo2D to
 *    AxisInfo. This change was made so that the AxisInfo
 *    class can be used for more than just 2D axes.
 *
 *
 ****************************IAxisAddible2D*****************************
 *  Revision 1.4  2003/07/25 14:36:21  dennis
 *  - Removed methods getLocalCoordBounds() and getGlobalCoordBounds()
 *    since these methods are not required by the AxisOverlay2D.
 *  - Moved method getRegionInfo() to IOverlayAddible
 *  - This interface now implements IOverlayAddible (Mike Miller)
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2003/06/13 14:44:54  dennis
 *  - Added methods getLocalCoordBounds() and getGlobalCoordBounds() to
 *    allow selection and annotation overlays to adjust when a zoom occurs.
 *    (Mike Miller)
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2003/05/16 14:59:53  dennis
 *  Added acknowlegement of NSF funding.
