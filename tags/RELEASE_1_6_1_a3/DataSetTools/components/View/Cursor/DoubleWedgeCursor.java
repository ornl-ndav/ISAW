 *  $Log$
 *  Revision 1.3  2003/12/16 01:43:41  millermi
 *  - Restructured selection so parameters define region
 *    in a counterclockwise direction.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2003/09/02 21:08:10  millermi
 *  - Removed bounding rectangle from cursor.
 *  - Directional vector new is redrawn when the wedge is being
 *    drawn, thus causing the vector to disappear.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2003/08/26 03:38:58  millermi
 *  - Initial Version - Makes rubberband cursor in the shape of a symmetric
 *    double wedge.
