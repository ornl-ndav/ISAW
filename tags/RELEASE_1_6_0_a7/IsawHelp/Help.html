views</FONT></U></B></P>

<P>Any region on the Image (not Graph) views can be zoomed into or
zoomed out by making a rectangular region with middle button on a
three button mouse or in the case of a two button mouse a region is
traced out by holding the two button down simultaneously.  Zooming out
requires a double click with the left mouse button.  For the Graph
View menu item &quot;Shift + Right Click&quot; will allow a region to
be defined for zooming and &quot;Control + Right Click&quot; returns
to the previous zoom level. Selections of &quot;Group ID's&quot; from
the image view is done with the &quot;s&quot; key.</P>

that can be invoked on &quot;DataSets&quot;</FONT></U></B></P>

<P> <B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Add a Scalar:</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">
</FONT>This operator adds a constant value to all y-values of
all Data blocks in a data set and places the result in a new DataSet.</P>

<P> <B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Subtract a Scalar:</FONT></B><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT>Similar to 'Add a Scalar', except the
constant value is subtracted from each y-value. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Multiply by Scalar:</FONT></B> Similar
to 'Add a Scalar', except the constant value is multiplied times
each y-value. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Divide by Scalar:</FONT></B> Similar
to 'Add a Scalar', except the constant value is divided into each
y-value. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Add a DataSet:</FONT></B> This operator
adds two DataSets by adding the corresponding Data blocks in the
DataSets to form a new DataSet. A Data block in the current DataSet
will be added to the first Data block in the second DataSet with
the same Group ID provided that they have the same units, the
same number of data values and extend over the same X-interval.
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Subtract a DataSet: </FONT></B>Similar
to 'Add a DataSet', except the Data blocks in the specified DataSet
are subtracted from the corresponding Data blocks in the current
DataSet. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Multiply by a DataSet:</FONT></B>
Similar to 'Add a DataSet', except the Data blocks in the specified
DataSet are multiplied times the corresponding Data blocks in
the current DataSet. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Divide by a DataSet:</FONT></B> Similar
to 'Add a DataSet', except the Data blocks in the specified DataSet
are divided into the corresponding Data blocks in the current
DataSet. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Integrate:</FONT></B> This operator
calculates the integral of the data values of one Data block.
The Group ID of the Data block to be integrated is specified by
the parameter 'Group ID'. The interval [a,b] over which the integration
is done is specified by the two endpoints a, b where it is assumed
that a &lt; b. This operator just produces a numerical result
that is displayed in the operator dialog box. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Calculate Moment:</FONT></B> This
operator calculates the integral of the data values times a power
of x. The Group ID of the Data block to be integrated is specified
by the parameter 'Group ID'. The power of x is specified by the
parameter 'Moment'. The interval [a,b] over which the integration
is done is specified by the two endpoints a, b where it is assumed
that a &lt; b. This operator just produces a numerical result
that is displayed in the operator dialog box. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Integrated Cross Section:</FONT></B>
This operator integrates each Data block in a DataSet over a specified
interval [a,b] and forms a new DataSet with one entry: a Data
block whose value at each of the original Data blocks is the value
of the integral for the original Data block. The new Data block
will have an X-Scale taken from an attribute of one of the original
Data blocks. The integral values will be ordered according to
increasing attribute value. If several Data blocks have the same
value of the attribute, their integral values are averaged. For
example, if the 'Raw Detector Angle' attribute is used and several
Data blocks have the same angle value, the integral values for
that angle are averaged to form the y-value that corresponds to
that angle in the new Data block. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Sort: </FONT></B>This operator constructs
a new DataSet that contains the same Data blocks as the original
DataSet, but ordered by some attribute of the Data blocks. For
example, if the attribute chosen is the 'Raw Detector Angle',
the Data blocks can be ordered in increasing or decreasing order
based on the physical angle of the first detector in the group
for that Data block. On the other hand, if the 'Effective Position'
attribute is used, the Data blocks can be ordered based on the
effective scattering angle to which the data was time-focused.
In this case a group at -30 degrees and .1 meter above the beam
plane and another group at +30 degrees and .1 meter above or below
the beam plane would appear next to each other since the scattering
angle for each group is the same. Although the Data blocks can
be sorted based on any attribute, the most useful attributes are
probably 'Group ID', 'Effective Position', 'Raw Detector Angle'
or user specified attributes such as temperature or pressure.
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Merge: </FONT></B>This operator creates
a new DataSet by combining the Data blocks from the current DataSet
with the Data blocks of a specified DataSet. This can only be
done if the two DataSets have the same X and Y units. If a DataSet
with N Data blocks is merged with a DataSet with M Data blocks,
the new DataSet will have N+M Data blocks. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Convert to Energy Loss:</FONT></B>
This operator creates a new DataSet from a time-of-flight DataSet
for direct geometry spectrometer. The new DataSet contains Data
blocks giving counts vs energy loss = energy_in - energy( tof
). </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Convert to d-Spacing: </FONT></B>This
operator creates a new DataSet from a time-of-flight DataSet for
diffractometer. The new DataSet contains Data blocks giving counts
vs d-Spacing. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Convert to Q:</FONT></B> This operator
creates a new DataSet from a time-of-flight DataSet for diffractometer.
The new DataSet contains Data blocks giving counts vs Q.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Convert to Energy:</FONT></B> This
operator creates a new DataSet from a time-of-flight DataSet for
either diffractometers or spectrometers. The new DataSet contains
Data blocks giving counts vs energy. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Convert to Wavelength:</FONT></B>
This operator creates a new DataSet from a time-of-flight DataSet
for either diffractometers or spectrometers. The new DataSet contains
Data blocks giving counts vs wavelength.
