<h1><Center> Interfaces of ISAW and Script Systems</Center></h1>
<ol Type ="A">
<li> IsawGUI.ISAW<ul>
   This project was originally designed to integrate with Isaw.  Isaw has currently 
   incorporated the CommandPane.<P>
   To send a data set to the Isaw program use the <A href ="ComDes.html#Send">Send </a> command.<P>
   
   </ul><P>
<li> Batch file
  <ul> These are currently supported. See <a href ="Examples1.html#Batch">Example</a>.<BR>
       <P>The java programs <B>Command.ScriptOperator</b> can be used to run a 
        script written in
       the Isaw Scripting Language and Jython outside of ISAW and
        the command pane.  Include the script filename on the command line as 
        the first argument.<P><P>
        The program <B>IsawGUI.IsawLite</B> can run installed scripts in Python, in the 
        Isaw Scripting language, or any Operator written with Java.  The argument requires the command name 
        of the script. If
        the script is not installed use the -i option. Type java IsawGUI.IsawLite -help for
        more information.
  </ul><P>
<li> Macro-simple
  <ul> A simple macro or a start on developing a macro or script with parameters:
       <ol type ="1">
      <li> Create the sequence of instructions in the CommandPane's Editor Pane or use any text editor.<P>
      <li> Make sure to use a lot of variables and assign them values at the top of the code<P>
      <li> Test the code and save it.<P>
      <li> Open the file in the CommandPane.<P>
      <li> Change the contents of the variables at the top<P>
      <li> Run this program<P>
      </ol> 
  </ul>
  Macros stored in a file can also be run, standalone, using the Command.ScriptOperator
  class
  or the IsawGUI.IsawLite class.  IsawLite requires the command name, not the filename.  For
  help on IsawLite, type "java IsawGUI.IsawLite -help".
  Invoke the ScriptOperator as follows:<ul> java Command.ScriptOperator filename </ul><P>
  Invoke IsawLite as <ul> java IsawGUI.IsawLite  commandName</ul> If the class is not 
  <a href="#install">installed</a>, use the -i option. <P>

<li> Macro with parameters written In the Isaw Scripting Language. 
       See <A href="Examples1.html#Parameters">Example</a>
  <ul> 
    A Macro or script with parameters can run in the CommandPane,in Isaw(File->Load Script), 
     or supplying
    the filename as an argument to the Command.ScriptOperator class.  Variable names that 
     represent 
    parameters are preceded by a "$", then
    followed by two "arguments" separated by spaces.  The first argument is the
    data type of the variable (immediately followed optionally by an initial value in
    parenthesis) and the third argument is a prompt that will 
    appear if a dialog box pops up requesting values for these parameters.<P>
<A  name="DataTypes">
   <OL> The parameter data types supported so far are
     <li> Integer or int, Float, DataSet, String , and Array (not case sensitive)
     <li> DataDirectoryString - Uses IsawProps.dat(property Data_Directory) to fill in a name
     <li> InstrumentNameString - Uses IsawProps.dat(property Default_Instrument) to fill in instrument name
     <li>DSSettableFieldString - Gives choices for  settable fields 
     <li> DSFieldString -Gives choice for fields that can be viewed
     <li> Choice( initValue) where initValue is a Script Array.  Creates a drop down choice box with the elements
           of the array.  The result is String 
     <li>LoadFileString- Will pop up an open file dialog box
     <li>SaveFileString -Will pop up a Save file dialog box
     <li>ServerTypeString- Will allow choice of a data server
     <li>SampleDataSet- Like DataSet but only Sample Data Sets will be selectable
     <li>MonitorDataSet- Like DataSet but only Monitor Data Sets will be selectable
     <li> Currently a lot more data types are available and are added dynamically to the
         system in the directory DataSetTools.parameter.  The name returned from the
         getType method of subclasses of ParameterGUI are further names that can be used in
         the scripting language.
   </ol>

  </ul><P>
<a name="JyOperators"></a>
<li> Macro with parameters written In the (Python)Jython Scripting Language.
    See <A href="Examples1.html#Python Operators">Example</a>
    <UL>  
        To be included as Macros into the ISAW system, the Jython Script must be written 
        in a special format that parallels the format for writing
        of Java operators.  Jython can be
        considered to be a "different dialect" of Java in interfacing with ISAW.
        
    </uL>
<li> With stand alone program
   <ul>  <ol type = "1"> Stand alone programs can use several forms of the CommandPane<P>
          <li> With the visual Elements<P>
          <li> Without the visual Elements<P>
          <li> Just the one line translator :execOneLine<P>
          <li> With a data set or data sets passed in at Construction time<P>
          <li> With a data set passed in using the addDataSet method<P>
          <li> The ScriptOperator class can execute a script.<P>
          <li> The IsawGUI.IsawLite can execute a command. Enter -help for more information
         </ol>

  </ul><P>

<li> With javac
  <ul> Most low-level routines have been extracted and repackaged so that they can be used
       by code written in java.  The routines are currently in the Command.ScriptUtil.class. 
       These can be used by Jython
       and Java code.<P><P>
        Code written in java and "compiled" can do the looping, if-then- else , etc. The 
      execution speed of this code will be faster than the code written in either 
      scripting language. <P><P>
      Java code can invoke either the ScriptProcessor, Command.ScriptOperator or 
           DataSetTools.operator.PyScriptOperator, to process Strings.
      

  </ul>
<a name="install"></a>
<li> Both Isaw and specially <a href="JyOperators">formatted Jython scripts</a> are now 
  "operators" and may be called by other scripts if installed. Operators are the Macros in
   the ISAW system. Currently these operators can be written in Java, the Isaw Scripting 
   Language, or Jython and can be used "interchangeably".
 <ul> To install scripts(and even operators written in Java), their corresponding filename
      must have the extension ".iss"(for Isaw Scripts),".py" (for Jython Scripts), or ".class" 
      (for Java operators). They
      also must be placed in specific directories as described below:  <P>
     <li> If a given directory is an install directory, any subdirectory of that directory
          is also an install directory. Scripts placed in any subdirectory of an install
          directory will be installed, if they are in the proper form.<P>
     <li> The ISAW\Scripts and ISAW\Operators subdirectory of the user's home directory are
          install directories. <P>
     <li> The Scripts and Operators subdirectory of the ISAW_HOME, GROUP_HOME, GROUP_HOMEx( x=0,1,2..)
          directories specified in the IsawProps.dat file is an install directory.<P>

     <li> Again subdirectories of install directories, subdirectories of subdirectories of
          install directories,etc. are all install directories.
     
  </ul>
</ol>
