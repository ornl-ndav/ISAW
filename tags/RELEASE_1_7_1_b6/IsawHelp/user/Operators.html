ISAW is a very extensible system.  One of the most important means of extending ISAW is by 
writing operators.  This report attempts to enumerate and expand the many different means to
 create operators.<P>
<a name="GROUPHOME"></a>
To incorporate any of these operators into ISAW, the file, compiled unless a script, must be 
placed in certain directories or their subdirectories.  These directories are the Script or 
Operator subdirectory of those directories specfied in the IsawProps.dat file after GROUP_HOME, 
GROUP1_HOME, GROUP2_HOME, etc.  Any subdirectory of any included directory is also included to
 any depth.<P>

<ul>Some elements that each operator must include:
   <li>The <B>command name</B>.  This is used by scripts to invoke the operator
   <li>The <B>Title</B>.  This is what appears on the drop down menus to signify this operator
   <li>The <B>Default parameters</B>.  The default parameters determine the data type of the parameters
      and also the GUI that is used to get the values of the parameters if needed.
   <li><B>Documentation</B>.  This is what is displayed in the help system and any help given for this
                   operator.
   <li><B>Calculation</B>.  This is the code that is executed when the operator is invoked.
   <li><B>Category</B> and Category list- This determines where in the menu system the operator will be
            listed. 
    </ul>
<LI><OL type="a"><a name="OpsWJava">Operators written using Java</a>
   <LI>Java Operators. <a href="Add2Ints1.html">Example</a>
    <UL>The Java Operator must subclass GenericOperator, DataSetOperator, or any subclass of these
classes. The subclass determines the Category and Category list for this operator unless overriden
by redefining the method getCategoryList.<P>
    
      <LI>The command name is the name returned by the getCommand method. If this method is ommitted, 
the command name is determined by the filename/classname.<P>
      <LI>The title is set by the super( Title) in the constructor for the operator.
      <LI><OL type ="1">The default parameters are set by the setDefaultParameter method.  This is mandatory. 
These operators have full capabilities of using any GUI available to input the new value of a 
parameter specified by the user.  A list of these means follow:
    <li> Old- <ul><u> addParameter( new Parameter( "Prompt for value", ObjInitValue));</u></ul>
                   The value must be some non-null Object type( except this is null if the
                   desired data type is Object).   The ObjInitValue can have data types 
                    corresponding to classes
                    in gov.anl.ipns.Util.SpecialStrings.  These data types pop up file choosers,
                    drop down menus, etc.<P>

    <li>New- Use ParameterGUI's in DataSetTools.parameter 
            <ul><u>addParameter( new FloatPG("prompt for value", 3.5));</u><ul>
     </OL><P>

    <LI>Documentation-is the result of the getDocumentation Method. The String result should conform
          to the input to IsawHelp.HelpSystem.HTMLizer.createHTML. See the examples for the format
           of the help string.  Other sections include @error, @assummptions and @algorithm<P>
   
     <LI>Calculation- This should be placed in the getResult method. The first code of the getResult
           method is to retrieve the parameter values from the GUI's that contains the parameter. 
           <UL>The code looks like the following:
          <li>Old
             <ul><u>float x = ((Float)(getParameter(3).getValue())).floatValue();</u></ul>

          <li>New
             <ul><u>float x  =((FloatPG)getParameter(3)).getfloatValue(); </u></ul>
          </ul><P>
    
   <LI>In addition, Java operators can redefine the clone() method, disable/enable a ParameterGUI
   depending upon a choice from another ParameterGUI, etc.<P><P>
   
   </ul>


     <LI><a name="JavaWrapped">Java wrapped Operators</a>. <a href="Add2Ints2.html">Example</a><P>
        <ol type="1">This essentially creates an operator out of a method with the following restrictions:
        <li> The method name MUST be calculate which has no parameters and returns an Object.
        <li> The parameters must be class global and public variables.  Their data types can only
           be int, Integer, float, Float, Vector, DataSet, a SpecialString in
           gov.anl.ipns.Util.SpecialStrings ,  boolean, Boolean, String,int[], int[][],
           int[][][], float[], float[][], float[][][]
        <li> There must be a getCommand method and a getDocumentation Method.
        <li> It can implement DataSetTools.operator.HiddenOperator if it is not to appear on any menu 
        <li> The Category and Title are determined by the filename/classname.
        </ol><P>
         There is a Wrapper Template stored in Isaw\Operators\Example\WrapperTemplate.java.  The
    package name( which determines the category list), the command name, the parameters, and the
    calculation must be changed.<P><P>
    </ol>
<LI><a name="Jython">Operators written using Jython(Python) Scripting Language</a>. 
                  <a href="Add2Ints3.html">Example</a><ul>
     Jython is a Java implementation for most of the Python language.  The extension
     language for Jython is Java not C.  This does mean, though, that Jython can do about anything 
     Java can do,  and it is a scripting language.<P>

     Jython can be used as a scipting language by itself, but to be incorporated into ISAW, it has
     to be written in a form similar to an operator written in Java( an operator that is not
     wrapped).  That means it must subclass GenericOperator, have getDocumentation, 
     setDefaultParameters, and getResult methods.  There are some examples of operators written
     in Jython in Wizard.TOF_SAD.  Forms are operators. <P>

     The advantage of writing Jython scripts as an operator is that it can be used by Java and the
     ISAW scripting language.<P><P>

     </ul>
<LI><a name="ISAWScripts">Operators written using the ISAW Scripting Language</a>.
      <a href="Add2Ints4.html">Example</a>
     <ul>
      Each ISAW Script is like a FORTRAN subroutine.  These are operators so any ISAW script is
      automatically incorporated into ISAW if it is in one of the directories that ISAW searches.
      <a href="#GROUPHOME">These are in the IsawProps.dat file.</a>  <P>

      Documentation lines are at the top of the script as comments, use #.
      The command name, title, and category list are determined automatically from the filename
      unless the script contains some or all of the following lines:
      <ul>
      <li>$ Title = Calculate Transmission
      <li>$ Command = Transmission
      <li>$ Category = Operator, Generic, TOF_SAD, Scripts
      </ul>
   </ul>
<LI><OL type="a"><a name="FORTRAN">Operators written using FORTRAN</a>
   
  <li>Convert to Java Wrapped operator. <a href="Add2Ints5.html">Example</a><ul>
     This utility, <b>Command.JavaCC.Fortran.Fcvrt <I>filename.f</I></b>, is used to translate simple Fortran
     subroutines to a 
     <a href="#JavaWrapped">Java Wrapped Operator</a>.  The aim is to translate simple
     subroutines or, for those who do not know Java, to write the code in FORTRAN as 
     opposed to Java.<P>
     <ul> Some notes
      <LI> Only a subset of FORTRAN is translated. Read, Write, Format, Open, GOTO, 
          computed and assigned goto's, Equivalence, common blocks are not supported.
      <li> Continuation lines(w.o. tabs) are supported. Arrays start at one by default.
      <li> A lot of the numeric intrinsic functions are supported. Character Types go 
           directly to Java Strings.  No Character operations are supported yet.
      <LI> The following subroutine calls can be used for output:
          <OL type="i">
          <LI> CALL WriteInt( intValue, 'I4') <P>
               Call WriteInt( unitNumber, intValue,'I5')<P>
          
          <LI> CALL WriteFloat( floatValue, 'F8.5') <P>
               Call WriteFloat( unitNumber, floatValue,'E8.3')<P>

          <LI> CALL WriteString( StringValue) <P>
               Call WriteString( unitNumber, StringValue)<P>

          <LI> CALL WriteLn <P>
               Call WriteLn( unitNumber)<P>
          <li> Intvar = WriteOpen( unitnumber, filename, intGotoError, intGotoEOF)<p>
                 Returns 0 or intGotoError or intGotoEOF<P>
          <li> IntVar= WriteClose( unitNumber, intGotoError)<P>
                 Returns 0 or intGotoError<P>
          </ol>
  
   The unitnumber in the above methods can be 0 through 11. Unit number 0 uses the logging
   system.  Unit number 6 goes to the status pane.<P>
   Other operators can use these methods.  They are in Command.JavaCC.Fortran.util. The Isaw 
   scripting language is about to get an operator shell around these methods.  It can use these
   methods too.

     <li> If an argument is an [multidimensional] array, the parameter is an input/output 
          parameter.  <P>
          There is a  problem with the ISAW scripting language in that it does not support
          true array data types.  It only supports Java Vectors.  To be able to use these operators
          with Java DataSets, other operators must be written to extract the arrays from the data set
          or other structures.<P>

     <LI> Non array parameters, like Integer, Real, Character,etc.  are input only in Java.  If a
          simple parameter must be an output parameter, this parameter must be converted to an 
               array with one 
          element. Operators will be necessary to extract elements from a real array for the
          ISAW scripting language.<P>

    <li> The resultant code is in the same directory as the FORTRAN source. The name of the operator
          is the name of the subroutine, not the filename.  A file can contain several subroutines.
          To invoke this translation <UL><U>
                  Command.JavaCC.Fortran.Fcvrt <I>filename.f</I></u></ul><P>
    <li> The resultant code must be compiled with javac or jikes.  Here line numbers for errors are 
         in the java code( .java file) not the FORTRAN code.  The code should look similar to 
          the FORTRAN code so you
         should be able to find the corresponding Fortran line number. Also, Fortran comment lines
         do translate to java comment lines.  These lines can be used to mark sections of the 
         code.  <p>
    </uL>
     </ul>
  <li><a name="JNIFOR">Via Java Native Interfaces</a><UL><P>
       FORTRAN subroutines can be compiled to dynamically linked libraries( Windows) or to unix
       libraries. In this form, the code is theoretically the same as C code.  The next section
       discusses some details concerning this type of interface to ISAW.
      </ul>
    </ol>
<LI><OL type="a"><a name="JNI">Operators written using C or C++</a>
  <LI>Via Java Native Interfaces<ul>
      Java is capable of using most code that can be placed in a library( dll for windows or so
      for unix). This means that the connection between a Java application and this code is made
      at run time.  The connection is determined by method name and argument types.  These are 
      often mangled according to special operating system dependent rules. The code must be translated
      for every operating system and possibly for different compilers and linkers on the same
      operating system.  It could be possible to compile some code with a parallelizing compiler
      for a multiprocessor system.  Since most code is "embarassingly" parallel, this could 
      easily speed up processing by a factor of 4.<P>
      There is work on systems to automatically connect different languages.  Currently these 
      include Babel, Jace, and Jacaw. I have had some initial success connecting java with FORTRAN
      using the gcc and g77 system.
      <OL type="1"> Some Steps and considerations in using JNI
         <LI> Each method or subroutine must have some glue code to specify the mangled names.  This
              code is written in C.
         <LI> Create a java class either for each library or for each method in the library.  This
               class  
              specifies the name of the method, the arguments and return type. For example<UL>
              <LI> C Method-<UL><U>
                        int Add2Ints( int FirstInt, int SecInt); </u></ul>

              <li> Compile the C/C++/Fortran code with glue to a library and install it. This is
                   compiler dependent. javah does not work with gcc and g77. An extra underscore

                   the appropriate glue. That system has an analog of javah. To link the C glue
                   code to the library requires externs, and some mangling too.
