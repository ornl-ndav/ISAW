 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.13  2004/03/15 03:31:25  dennis
 * Moved view components, math and utils to new source tree
 * gov.anl.ipns.*
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2003/08/28 18:54:31  dennis
 * Added support for .csd files (concatenated files from the
 * Ideas MC simulation program)
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2003/06/13 22:01:15  bouzekc
 * Now extends RobustFileFilter to take care of common
 * functionality.  Removed setExtension() method and
 * SaveFilter variable.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2002/11/27 23:27:07  pfpeterson
 * standardized header
