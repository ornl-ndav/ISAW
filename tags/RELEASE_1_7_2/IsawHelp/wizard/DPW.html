  The Wizards are meant as a tool to bridge the gap between analyzing data
  using the ISAW program, which is a fully flexible analysis, and analyzing
  data using scripts, which are fast but only run sequentially.<br><br>
  The Wizards allow you to perform predetermined steps one at a time, view
  intermediate results, and go back to change and/or optimize inputs in a
  previous step.

  <font size=+3>Starting the SCD Wizards</font>
  </center>
  <hr>
  The ISAW Wizards are not yet available from the main ISAW program.  You must
  open a command prompt in order to run the wizards.  In addition, 
  your classpath must be properly set up in order to run the Wizards.  If you
  are running a downloaded version of ISAW, your classpath should be set
  correctly already.  If you are using source from CVS or your classpath is not
  set, you must set your classpath so that it includes the directory that you 
  put the source code into.  You can also specify the classpath directly when
  running the Wizards.  If you need to specify the classpath directly, you will
  need to enter the full path to the ISAW installation directory (we will
  denote this as ${ISAW_HOME}).<br><br>
  To run the Wizards, type<br><br><code>
  java Wizard.TOF_SCD.InitialPeaksWizard</code><br><br>
  for the Initial Peaks Wizard, or<br><br><code>
  java Wizard.TOF_SCD.DailyPeaksWizard</code><br><br>
  for the Daily Peaks Wizard.  If these do not work for you, it is likely that
  your classpath is incorrectly set.  A temporary fix is to specify the
  classpath directly:<br><br><code>
  java -cp $CLASSPATH:${ISAW_HOME} Wizard.TOF_SCD.InitialPeaksWizard</code><br><br>
  for the Initial Peaks Wizard, or<br><br><code>
  java -cp $CLASSPATH:${ISAW_HOME} Wizard.TOF_SCD.DailyPeaksWizard</code><br><br>
  for the Daily Peaks Wizard.

  <font size=+3>General use of the Wizards</font>
  </center>
  <hr>
  There are several ways to navigate through the Wizards.  The double arrow
  buttons move to the first step or the last step and the single arrows move
  one step forward or backward.<br><br>
  To execute an intermediate step, you can click on the "Do" button, and to
  execute all steps, you can click on the "Do All" button.  To view the results
  and parameters of the intermediate steps, you can select "View" from the menu
  bar then select the parameter you want to view.<br><br>
  To get help on the Wizard or a particular step, you can click on the "Help"
  option in the menu bar, then click on "On Wizard" or "On Current Form"
  respectively.<br><br>
  To save your progress, you can click on the "File" option in the menu bar,
  then click on "Save Wizard State", then type the file name that you want to
  save your progress to.  A ".wsf" extension is automatically appended to the
  name.  In a similar manner, you can load a previously saved Wizard using
  "File" then "Load Wizard State."<br><br>
  Clicking on "Reset" or "Reset All" will clear the progress bar for the
  current step or all steps, respectively.  This allows you to rerun one or
  more steps without changing any parameters.<br><br>
  To set a working or projects directory, select "Projects Directory" from the
  wizard menu, then simply select the directory you want.  The projects directory 
  will coerce the file browsers to initially open to your selected directory.

  <font size=+3>SCD Daily Peaks Wizard</font>
  </center>
  <hr>
  This Wizard is meant to be used for multiple runs after a baseline has been
  established using the Initial Peaks Wizard.  There are four steps in this 
  Wizard:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Finding peaks</li>
    <li>Indexing the peaks</li>
    <li>Refining the orientation matrix with a least squares routine.</li>
    <li>Integrating the peaks.</li>
  </ol>
  Typically steps 2 and 3 are iterated over until you find an orientation
  matrix that is satisfactory to you.

  <ol>
    <li>
    <font size=+1>Finding Peaks</font><br><br>
    Here is a screenshot of step 1 of the Wizard:<br><br>
    <img src="images/DPForm1.jpg"><br><br>
    This step is used to find peaks from a single run using several parameters.
    The result is a peaks file.
    <br><br>Its parameters are:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Raw data path: This is the directory the runfiles are in (e.g.
      C:\\ISAW\SampleRuns).  If you are using the Browse button to find this
      directory, you must highlight the directory you want rather than going
      into the directory.</li>
      <li>Output data path: This is the directory you want the resultant output
      to go to.</li>
      <li>Run numbers: Here is where you enter the run number you want to
      analyze.  For example, if you are analyzing SCD06497.RUN, you would enter
      06497 or 6497 here.</li>
      <li>Experiment name: This is the name of your experiment (e.g. quartz).
      Note that this name will be used for the peaks file naming (e.g.
      quartz.peaks).</li>
      <li>Maximum number of peaks: This is the maximum number of peaks you want
      listed in the peaks file.</li>
      <li>Minimum peak intensity: The minimum intensity that a peak should have
      to be included in a file.</li>
      <li>Append data to file: If you have an existing peaks file that you wish
      this analysis to be appended to, check this box.  In order for this to
      work, the peaks file must be named, for example, quartz.peaks if your
      experiment name is quartz.  If the file does not exist, you will get an
      error.</li>
      <li>SCD calibration file line to use: this is the line of the specified
      calibration file to use for this analysis.  Putting a -1 here will select
      the most recent data.</li>
      <li>SCD calibration file: This is the fully qualified name of the 
      calibration file to use (e.g. C:\\ISAW\SampleRuns\instprm.dat).
      </li>
      <li>Pixel rows and columns to keep: This is the range of values of the
      detector pixel information to keep.  Note that a square detector is
      assumed, so if you have a 100 x 100 pixel detector, and you want to
      remove 10 pixels on each side (due to noise, etc.), you would put 10:90
      in this field.</li>
    </ol>
    </li><br>

    <li>
    <font size=+1>Indexing the peaks</font><br><br>
    Here is a screenshot of step 2 of the Wizard:<br><br>
    <img src="images/DPForm2.jpg"><br><br>
    This step is where you will index the peaks that were found in step 1.  
    Its output is the file index.log.
    <br><br>Its parameters are:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Delta h: This is the allowable h uncertainty</li>
      <li>Delta k: This is the allowable k uncertainty</li>
      <li>Delta l: This is the allowable l uncertainty</li>
      <li>Update peaks file: checking this box will update the peaks file with
      the indexing information.</li>
      <li>Get matrix file from: This allows you to select what matrix file to
      use.  You can use a single matrix file (from the Initial Peaks Wizard or
      an overall least squares fitted matrix) or
      you can use the result of step 3, which is a set of matrix files for each
      run number you have entered.<br><br>
      The first time through the wizard, you will usually select "From a File."  
      If you choose "From LsqrsJ", the Wizard will assume that there exists a
      matrix file for each run as well as an overall matrix.
      For example, if you are using runs 6496 to 6498, with the experiment name
      quartz, the Wizard will expect to find lsquartz06496.mat,
      lsquartz06497.mat, lsquartz06498.mat in the raw data path.<br><br>
      When it finds these files, it will restrict the indexing of a run number 
      to the least squares matrix corresponding to that name.  For example,
      indexing of the peaks for run number 6497 will only be done using
      lsquartz06497.mat.</li>
      <li>Matrix file to load: This is only available if "From a File" is
      selected in the previous parameter.  This allows you to select what
      matrix file you want to use for indexing the peaks.</li>
      <li>Restrict runs: This is only available if "From a File" is
      selected in the previous parameter.  This allows you to restrict indexing
      of the peaks using your selected matrix to certain runs.  Leaving this
      blank will include all runs.</li>
    </ol>
    </li><br>

    <li>
    <font size=+1>Refining the orientation matrix</font><br><br>
    Here is a screenshot of step 3 of the Wizard:<br><br>
    <img src="images/DPForm3.jpg"><br><br>
    This step is where you will refine the initial orientation matrix based on
    the results of indexing the peaks.  Its output is the lsqrsj.log file, as 
    well as an orientation matrix for each run number and an overall
    orientation matrix.
    <br><br>Its parameters are:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Restrict peaks sequence numbers:  These are the sequence numbers that
      you want to restrict the refinement of the matrix to.</li>
      <li>Minimum peak intensity threshold: The minimum intensity that a peak 
      should have to be included in the refinement.</li>
      <li>Pixel rows and columns to keep: This is the range of values of the
      detector pixel information to keep.  Note that a square detector is
      assumed, so if you have a 100 x 100 pixel detector, and you want to
      remove 10 pixels on each side (due to noise, etc.), you would put 10:90
      in this field.</li>
    </ol>
    </li><br>

    <li>
    <font size=+1>Integrating the peaks</font><br><br>
    Here is a screenshot of step 4 of the Wizard:<br><br>
    <img src="images/DPForm4.jpg"><br><br>
    This step is used to integrate the peaks from the multiple runs.  It can
    also include any runs done using the Initial Peaks Wizard (i.e. it is not
    limited to the run numbers that were entered in step 1).  Its output is 
    experiment_name.integrate, the file of integrated peaks.
    <br><br>Its parameters are:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Run numbers: These are the run numbers that you want to integrate the
      peaks for.</li>
      <li>Centering type: This is the crystal center type to use (e.g. face
      centered).</li>
      <li>Time-slice range: This is the range to use for the time-slice.</li>
      <li>Amount to increase slice size by: This is used as an increment value
      for the time slice range.</li>
      <li>Append to file: Check this box if you have a previous .integrate file
      that you want the results of this step appended to.</li>
      <li>Use shoe box: ????????</li>
      <li>Box delta x (col) range: ????????? </li>
      <li>Box delta y (row) range: ????????? </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
