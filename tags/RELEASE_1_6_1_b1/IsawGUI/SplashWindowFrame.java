 * Modified:
 *
 *  $Log$
 *  Revision 1.19  2004/01/24 23:09:39  bouzekc
 *  Removed unused imports.
 *
 *  Revision 1.18  2003/12/12 18:15:18  dennis
 *  Temporarily commented out code that waited for an image to finish
 *  loading, using a MediaTracker.  This permitted the splash pane to
 *  appear with the image "simultaneously".  This code was commented
 *  out in a continuing attempt to fix intermittent problems with ISAW
 *  starting.
 *
 *  Revision 1.17  2003/12/11 18:24:52  dennis
 *    Now uses the WindowShower utility class to display the splash window
 *  from the Swing event handling thread, instead of showing it directly.
 *  This fixes an intermittent problem where Isaw would "hang" while
 *  loading on Linux, using j2sdk 1.4.2_02.
 *    Added code to start the thread that disposes of the splash screen
 *  after a period of time, so that the thread does not need to be started
 *  in the ISAW main program.
 *    Did some general code clean up and improved javadocs.
 *
 *  Revision 1.16  2003/02/13 21:45:13  pfpeterson
 *  Removed calls to deprecated function fixSeparator.
 *
 *  Revision 1.15  2003/02/13 17:28:33  pfpeterson
 *  Moved decision making for image directory to PropertiesLoader.
 *
 *  Revision 1.14  2003/02/12 21:20:02  pfpeterson
 *  Now checks properties for IMAGE_DIR before going to ISAW_HOME/images
 *  for the splashscreen image.
 *
 *  Revision 1.13  2002/12/11 17:25:20  pfpeterson
 *  Now scales image used in splash screen to the size of the splash screen.
 *
 *  Revision 1.12  2002/11/27 23:27:07  pfpeterson
 *  standardized header
 *
 *  Revision 1.11  2002/06/14 15:57:20  pfpeterson
 *  Use the ShareData.getProperty() method to get ISAW_HOME.
