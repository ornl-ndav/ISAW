#
#    This file describes the initial path length and the sizes and positions 
#  of the detector panels for the SMARTS instrument at LANSCE.  The information
#  MUST occurr on lines in the order shown, with the specified names.
#  The spectra corresponding to the first pixel on the grid MUST occur in 
#  the DataSet in sequence, starting with the specified "First_Index".  NOTE:
#  in this file these indicies are numbered starting at 1.  That is, the
#  spectrum with index 1 in this file will be the spectrum in position 0
#  of the DataSet.
#
#    Once a value is set, such as Num_Cols set to 32, it stays set for the
#  remaining detectors in the file.  It can be set to a different value for
#  any detector, and the new value will apply to all subsequent detectors,
#  unless it is changed again.
