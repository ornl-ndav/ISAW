<H1><Center> Reduce Wizard </Center></H1><P>

This wizards executes the Reduce code for sand instruments.  The wizard assumes the
following files have been created from the raw data:
  <ol>
   <li> Sensitivity File
   <li> Efficiency File
   <li> Background Transmission file
   <li> (optional) Sample Transmission File.
  </ol>

  The wizard will calculate the processed Sample Transmission file if it has not yet been processed.<P>

  There are options to select whether or not the information from the Background Transmission run
  or Cadmium run is to be used.<P>

  <ol> The data files processed by the sand wizard are
   <li> The sample run
   <li> The Background Run
   <li> (optional)The Cadmium Run
  </ol><P>
   
 All data is first rebinned to a common lambda scale. Also the Neutron delay  and 
 the beam offset adjustments are made. Then the following calculations are made :
 <ol>
              <li> Calculate S1 =Sample/ Sample Monitor,  C1 = Cadmium/Cadmium Monitor  and
                    B1 = Background/Background Monitor.  These monitors are the downstream monitors.
                   
              <li> Calculate Sample1 = (S1-C1)/sensitivity/Efficiency  and Background1 =
                     (B1-C1)/sensitivity/Efficiency
  </ol> 

 <ul> Results can be either "1D" or "2D"
    <li> "1D" results is just 3 spectra with q versus the adjusted intensity.  The adjusted intensity
          is calculated as follows:
          <Ul> The Sample1 and Background1 above are "rebinned" to a common q scale and all the spectra
               are
               summed(weighted).  This yields two spectra Sample2 and Background2. The third spectra is
               Sample2-Background2.

          </Ul>

   <li> "2D" results is 3 2D spectra of Qx by Qy versus adjusted intensity which is calculated as follows:
       <UL> Each "pixel" in Sample1 is converted to a Qx, Qy pixel and its weigthed intensity is added to the
            corresponding Qx,Qy bin.  The same is done for Background1.  The results of these two operations
            yields two 2D spectra.  The third is the difference of these results.
      </ul>
