<ul>Features of the language
<li>
It is NOT case sensitive except (presently) for the Data set Commands</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<li>
There is one instruction per line</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<li>
Expressions are possible anywhere a constant or variable occurs, except
as the target of an assignment statement</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<li>
See <a href="ComDes.html">Commands</a> for supported commands</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<li>
true and false are supported ONLY as arguments of functions. No algebra
is allowed for these.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<li>
Float constants must have a decimal point. Integers constants do NOT have
a decimal point.</li>

<li>
The REM statement as the first "command" on a line is considered documentation</li>

<li>
Presently there are no if- then- else or subroutines structures</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<li>
for loop is implemented as follows:</li>

<ul>&nbsp;
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I in [1,3,5,6]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDFOR
</pre>
The list at the right can only be a list of numbers, strings, or variables
and expressions.
<p>To denote RANGES use :. For example
<p>[1<b> :</b> N] or [ 1 , 3 ,&nbsp; 8 <b>: </b>15 , 2 ]
<p>The Ranges only work for integers and can be decreasing.</ul>

<li>
An ON ERROR - ELSE ERROR - END ERROR structure has been set up</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<li>
A form of arrays have been implemented as follow:</li>

<ul>&nbsp;Res[1] is Res1
<p>Res[i] is Res3 if i evaluates to 3 Res[2*i+1] is Res7 if i is 3</ul>
</ul>
