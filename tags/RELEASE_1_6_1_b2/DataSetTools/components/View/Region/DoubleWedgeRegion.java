 *
 * Modified:
 *
 *  $Log$
 *  Revision 1.7  2004/02/14 03:34:56  millermi
 *  - selectedpoints no longer includes point found off the image.
 *  - added toString() method.
 *
 *  Revision 1.6  2004/01/07 06:44:53  millermi
 *  - Added static method getRegionUnion() which removes duplicate
 *    points from one or more selections.
 *  - Added protected methods initializeSelectedPoints() and
 *    getRegionBounds(). Each is needed by getRegionUnion()
 *    to calculate a unique set of points.
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2003/12/23 18:39:22  millermi
 *  - Improved how region was calculated.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2003/12/20 05:42:26  millermi
 *  - Now corrects the topleft/bottomright defining points if
 *    they were scaled incorrectly by the image.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2003/12/16 01:45:08  millermi
 *  - Changed way selected points are calculated, now uses
 *    two WedgeRegion instances to calculate the points
 *    in the region.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2003/10/22 20:26:09  millermi
 *  - Fixed java doc errors.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2003/08/26 03:38:19  millermi
 *  - Initial Version - Allows double wedge selected regions to be passed to
 *    the viewer. Restricts wedge angle to 180 degrees.

/**
 * This class is a specific region designated by three points.
 * The DoubleWedgeRegion is used to pass points selected by a
 * symmetric double wedge region (in SelectionOverlay) from the view
 * component to the viewer. Given the defining points of a region,
 * this class can return all of the points inside the selected region. 
 * The defining points of the double wedge are same as the wedge:
 * 
 * p[0]   = center pt of circle that arc is taken from
 * p[1]   = last mouse point/point at intersection of line and arc
 * p[2]   = reflection of p[1]
 * p[3]   = top left corner of bounding box around arc's total circle
 * p[4]   = bottom right corner of bounding box around arc's circle
 * p[5].x = startangle, the directional vector in degrees
 * p[5].y = degrees covered by arc.
 *
 * The large number of defining points replaces the work of recalculating
 * information at each step of the region calculation. Like a ElipseRegion,
 * this region may appear to be circular, but may actually be eliptical.
