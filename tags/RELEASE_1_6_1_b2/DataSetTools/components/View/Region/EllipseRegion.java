 * Modified:
 *
 *  $Log$
 *  Revision 1.6  2004/02/14 03:34:56  millermi
 *  - selectedpoints no longer includes point found off the image.
 *  - added toString() method.
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2004/01/07 06:44:53  millermi
 *  - Added static method getRegionUnion() which removes duplicate
 *    points from one or more selections.
 *  - Added protected methods initializeSelectedPoints() and
 *    getRegionBounds(). Each is needed by getRegionUnion()
 *    to calculate a unique set of points.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2003/12/20 07:04:48  millermi
 *  - Fixed copy/paste bug that caused an array out of bounds
 *    exception.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2003/12/20 05:42:25  millermi
 *  - Now corrects the topleft/bottomright defining points if
 *    they were scaled incorrectly by the image.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2003/12/18 22:38:00  millermi
 *  - Tweaked how x/yextent are calculated. Now must have a different
 *    of more than one to be reset.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2003/11/26 18:46:56  millermi
 *  - Renamed ElipseRegion.java to EllipseRegion.java
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2003/11/26 01:57:44  millermi
 *  - Improved selection process.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2003/10/22 20:26:09  millermi
 *  - Fixed java doc errors.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2003/08/11 23:40:40  millermi
 *  - Initial Version - Used to pass region info from a
 *    ViewComponent to the viewer. WCRegion is an unrelated
 *    class that passes info from the overlay to the
 *    ViewComponent.
