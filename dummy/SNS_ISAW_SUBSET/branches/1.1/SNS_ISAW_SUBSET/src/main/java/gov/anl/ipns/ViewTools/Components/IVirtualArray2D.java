 * Modified:
 *
 *  $Log: IVirtualArray2D.java,v $
 *  Revision 1.13  2006/03/30 23:57:55  dennis
 *  Modified to not require the use of mutator methods for the
 *  virtual arrays.  These changes were required since the concept
 *  of a "mutable" virtual array was separated from the concept of
 *  a virtual array.
 *
 *  Revision 1.12  2005/06/06 14:33:05  dennis
 *  Removed method declaration, setAxisInfo( i, axis_info ), since that
 *  method was moved to the IVirtualArray class.
 *
 *  Revision 1.11  2005/03/12 18:09:52  millermi
 *  - Updated javadocs for getDataValue().
 *
 *  Revision 1.10  2004/09/15 21:55:44  millermi
 *  - Updated LINEAR, TRU_LOG, and PSEUDO_LOG setting for AxisInfo class.
 *    Adding a second log required the boolean parameter to be changed
 *    to an int. These changes may affect any ObjectState saved configurations
 *    made prior to this version.
 *
 *  Revision 1.9  2004/03/17 20:26:50  dennis
 *  Fixed @see tag that was broken when view components, math and
 *  util were moved to gov package.
 *
 *  Revision 1.8  2004/03/15 23:53:50  dennis
 *  Removed unused imports, after factoring out the View components,
 *  Math and other utils.
 *
 *  Revision 1.7  2004/03/12 02:07:59  millermi
 *  - Changed SharedData to SharedMessages.
 *  - Changed package and fixed imports.
 *
 *  Revision 1.6  2004/02/16 05:21:38  millermi
 *  - Added methods getErrors(), setErrors(), setSquareRootErrors(),
 *    and getErrorValue() which allow an array of errors to be
 *    associated with the data in that array.
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2003/12/18 22:33:50  millermi
 *  - Removed getAxisInfoVA(), now done in IVirtualArray.
 *  - All references to AxisInfo2D changed to AxisInfo.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2003/10/22 20:15:08  millermi
 *  - Removed methods now defined by IVirtualArray.
 *  - Added java docs where needed.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2003/08/07 15:56:14  dennis
 *  - Added method setAxisInfoVA() with alternate parameters.
 *    Since getAxisInfoVA() returns an AxisInfo2D object, this
 *    new method takes in an AxisInfo2D object.
 *    (Mike Miller)
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2003/05/16 15:01:54  dennis
 *  Minor fix to java doc comments and added acknowledgement of NSF funding.

/**
 * This interface is implemented by classes that can produce a "logical"
 * 2-D array of floats and is used to pass data to viewers and view components.
 * Along with the data, some information, such as at title, and axis labels 
 * and units, are kept with the virtual array.  An IVirtualArray2D has the 
 * same logical format as a typical 2D array.
 * Below is an example of an M x N virtual array.<br><br>
 *
 * | (0,0)    (0,1)   (0,2)  ...  (0,N-1)  |<br>
 * | (1,0)    (1,1)   (1,2)  ...  (1,N-1)  |<br>
 * | (2,0)    (2,1)   (2,2)  ...  (2,N-1)  |<br>
 * |  ...   ...   ...  ...   ...           |<br>
 * | (M-1,0) (M-1,1) (M-1,2) ... (M-1,N-1) |<br>
 *
 * All references to rows and columns are interpretted
 * to mean row number and column number where an
 * M x N array has M rows, and N columns. The row numbers
 * start at zero and go to M-1 and the column numbers
 * start at zero and go to N-1. 
 *
 * In the current version of IVirtualArray2D, the values of the array cannot 
 * be set.  This is to allow the interface to be implemented by classes that
 * calculate or extract a regular array of values from some more complicated
 * underlying data structures.  In such cases, it is not meaningiful to set
 * the values, just to get them.  IF the values must be set, then the 
 * IMutableVirtualArray2D interface should be implemented.
 *
