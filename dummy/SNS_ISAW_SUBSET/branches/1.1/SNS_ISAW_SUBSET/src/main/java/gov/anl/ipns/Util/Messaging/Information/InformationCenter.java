 * Initial checkin. The InformationHandler and InformationCenter interface
 * and class form the base of an information communication system.
 * For a particular piece of information, exactly one InformationHandler is
 * registered with an InformationCenter to be responsible for retrieving
 * the information at any time.  Next, the center can acquire the
 * information just based on its key.  Classes don't have to know where or
 * how the information is stored or who stores the information.

/**
 * This class acts as a central warehouse of data that is shared by 
 * several different <code>InformationHandler</code> objects.  It allows 
 * the objects to access the shared data without having to know where or 
 * how the data is stored.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example of how this class is used:
 * <ul>
 *   Suppose that there are four variables x, y, z, and w such that each 
 *   Object X, Y, Z, and W uses all some or none of the variables in its 
 *   operation.  Moreover, suppose that Object X will actually be storing 
 *   the data for variable x, Object Y for variable y, and so forth.  Then, 
 *   this class can be used in the following way.  Each object will have a 
 *   reference to an <code>InformationCenter</code> object.  Object X will 
 *   register itself with the <code>InformationCenter</code> using one of 
 *   the <code>registerHandler()</code> methods and will specify some string 
 *   key (for example "varX") that will be used to refer to the data for 
 *   variable x.  The other objects will do the same. Then, suppose that one 
 *   of the Objects, say Z, wants to get the data for variable x.  All it 
 *   would have to do is invoke the <code>obtainValue("varX")</code> method 
 *   on the <code>InformationCenter</code> to obtain the data stored for the 
 *   variable x.  The <code>InformationCenter</code> is responsible for 
 *   determining where to acquire the data and to get the correct data 
 *   back.  It is also designed such that given some data that this class 
 *   maintains, there is exactly one <code>InformationHandler</code> that is 
 *   responsible for storing that data.  This means that for any data, it 
 *   will be consistently be accessed through the same 
 *   <code>InformationHandler</code> object.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The design of this class, as described above, has several benefits.  
 * First, it allows for abstraction.  That is, if several Objects need to 
 * refer to the data encapsulated by a specific variable, by using an instance 
 * of this class, the Objects do not need to know where or how the data is 
 * stored to acquire the data.  They only need to know the key that is used 
 * to reference the data.  Next, the way this class is designed, it makes 
 * some <code>InformationHandler</code> store some particular data.  The 
 * <code>InformationHandler</code> in turn just registers itself with an 
 * instance of this class to allow the class to know which data the 
 * <code>InformationHandler</code> is storing.  This allows for 
 * efficiency optimizations.  Here is an example how:  
 * <ul>
 *   Suppose Object X uses variable x 90% of the time, Object Y using it 
 *   5% of the time, and Object Z using it 5% of the time.  Then, Object X 
 *   could be responsible for storing the data for variable x and will 
 *   register itself with an instance of this class.  Then, when Object X 
 *   wants to use variable x it can reference it directly as a field (without  
 *   having to ask the instance of this class for the data).  However, Objects 
 *   Y and Z have to use the instance of this class to access the data for 
 *   variable x.  Asking an instance of this class for the data for a  
 *   particular variable takes a little more stack space than accessing a  
 *   class's fields directly.  This is because when asking an instance of 
 *   this class for some particular data, it has to in turn find the correct 
 *   <code>InformationHandler</code> and ask it for the data.  When accessing 
 *   a field to acquire some data, fewer and even no method calls need to be 
 *   made to access the data.  Thus, this class lets the Objects that use the 
 *   data most often store the data.  To improve efficiency they can in 
 *   turn access the data directly as a field.  However, to allow for 
 *   abstraction any othe Object that uses the data can easily access the data 
 *   through an instance of this class.
 * </ul>
