 * Modified:
 *
 *  $Log: IViewComponent1D.java,v $
 *  Revision 1.9  2006/07/25 20:44:42  amoe
 *  Fixed javadoc.
 *
 *  Revision 1.8  2006/07/19 17:33:39  dennis
 *  Changed get/setPointedAt() methods to work with floatPoint2D,
 *  rather than java.awt.Point.  This change is needed so that
 *  the 1D view component deals with the PointedAt concept in
 *  the same coordinate system as the other view components.
 *  Also, added dataChanged( IVirtualArray1DList ) to this
 *  interface.  It was present in implementing classes, but
 *  should be in the interface, so that different implementing
 *  classes could be used polymorphically.
 *
 *  Revision 1.7  2004/03/15 23:53:51  dennis
 *  Removed unused imports, after factoring out the View components,
 *  Math and other utils.
 *
 *  Revision 1.6  2004/03/12 02:17:07  rmikk
 *  Fixed package names
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2004/01/23 19:35:30  serumb
 *  Added the GPL.
