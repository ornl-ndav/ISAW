 *  $Log: EllipseRegion.java,v $
 *  Revision 1.12  2007/07/30 14:30:33  dennis
 *  The originally specified defining points are now modified to
 *  enforce symmetry.  Since the originaly defining points are
 *  typically obtained by transforming pixel locations (integer
 *  coordinates on a grid) to WorldCoordinates, symmetry conditions
 *  are often violated.  The constructor now adjusts the positions
 *  of the defining points (except for the center point) as needed
 *  to preserve symmetry.  This fixes a bug where a region would
 *  not seem to be constructed properly and would have a slightly
 *  different boundary after being drawn by a region editior.
 *
 *  Revision 1.11  2007/03/16 16:57:56  dennis
 *  Major refactoring.  This class is now derived from the
 *  RegionWithInterior class.  The getSelectedPoints() method is
 *  implemented uniformly in the base class, RegionWithInterior.
 *  This is a major simplification.  The key method is the
 *  isInsideWC(x,y) that determines which world coordinate points
 *  are inside the region, and getRegionBoundsWC() that provides
 *  a bounding rectangle for this region in world coordinates.
 *  Removed initializeSelectedPoints() method that is no longer
 *  needed.
 *
 *  Revision 1.10  2004/05/20 20:48:26  millermi
 *  - Constructor now initializes world and image bounds to
 *    the bounds of the defining points.
 *
 *  Revision 1.9  2004/05/20 17:02:26  millermi
 *  - Made method getRegionBounds() public so it may be used by
 *    outside classes.
 *
 *  Revision 1.8  2004/03/15 23:53:51  dennis
 *  Removed unused imports, after factoring out the View components,
 *  Math and other utils.
 *
 *  Revision 1.7  2004/03/12 02:09:06  rmikk
 *  Fixed package names
 *
 *  Revision 1.6  2004/02/14 03:34:56  millermi
 *  - selectedpoints no longer includes point found off the image.
 *  - added toString() method.
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2004/01/07 06:44:53  millermi
 *  - Added static method getRegionUnion() which removes duplicate
 *    points from one or more selections.
 *  - Added protected methods initializeSelectedPoints() and
 *    getRegionBounds(). Each is needed by getRegionUnion()
 *    to calculate a unique set of points.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2003/12/20 07:04:48  millermi
 *  - Fixed copy/paste bug that caused an array out of bounds
 *    exception.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2003/12/20 05:42:25  millermi
 *  - Now corrects the topleft/bottomright defining points if
 *    they were scaled incorrectly by the image.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2003/12/18 22:38:00  millermi
 *  - Tweaked how x/yextent are calculated. Now must have a different
 *    of more than one to be reset.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2003/11/26 18:46:56  millermi
 *  - Renamed ElipseRegion.java to EllipseRegion.java
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2003/11/26 01:57:44  millermi
 *  - Improved selection process.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2003/10/22 20:26:09  millermi
 *  - Fixed java doc errors.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2003/08/11 23:40:40  millermi
 *  - Initial Version - Used to pass region info from a
 *    ViewComponent to the viewer. WCRegion is an unrelated
 *    class that passes info from the overlay to the
 *    ViewComponent.
