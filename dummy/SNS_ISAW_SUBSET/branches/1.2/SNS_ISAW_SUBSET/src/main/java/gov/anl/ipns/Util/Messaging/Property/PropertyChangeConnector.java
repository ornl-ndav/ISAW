 * thought of as nodes that are positioned on the outer edge of a circle.  
 * Then, a <code>PropertyChangeConnector</code> can be thought of as 
 * a node at the center of the circle.  When a property has changed, one 
 * of the <code>PropertyChangeHandlers</code> on the edge of the circle 
 * would inform the <code>PropertyChangeConnector</code> at the circle's 
 * center via the 
 * {@link #propertyChanged(String, Object, PropertyChangeHandler) 
 * propertyChanged()} method.  The <code>PropertyChangeConnector</code> 
 * would in turn redirect the message to all of the <b>other</b> 
 * <code>PropertyChangeHandlers</code> <b>exactly once</b>.  Thus, in 
 * summary, this class is used to redirect messages across several 
 * <code>PropertyChangeHandlers</code> and is responsible for making sure 
 * that each <code>PropertyChangeHandler</code> is informed exactly once.
