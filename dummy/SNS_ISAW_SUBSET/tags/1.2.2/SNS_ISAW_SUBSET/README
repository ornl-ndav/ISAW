******** Readme File for SNS_ISAW_SUBSET ******************

Date: 7/26/06


  This directory contains a subset of the ISAW source tree, that "should" be
sufficient to fully support the use of classe like Display1D, Display2D
and Display3D.  The following are included:

extract_SNS_subset.sh  Simple script to extract the needed files from an 
                       ISAW source tree, or unpacked distribution.
                       NOTE: This script includes useful comments on what
                             files are copied and why.  It might be helpful
                             to read over script.

SNS_SUBSET_JARS        Contains jar files with JUST the compiled class files,
                       no source.  The jar files are:
                           DataSetTools.jar   11  K
                           ExtTools.jar       2.5 K
                           gov.jar            973 K
                           SSG_Tools.jar      364 K
                       for a total of 1.356 Megabytes.  This is essentially
                       the minimum size needed to support the full 
                       functionality of the viewers, without actually 
                       altering any source files in ISAW to discard 
                       functionality.

SNS_SUBSET             Contains the full expanded source files for the 
                       listed jar files.

SNS_SUBSET_JAVADOC     HTML Java Docs for the SNS_SUBSET classes.

README.SNS_ISAW        This readme file.


NOTE: There are "hooks" in the system to support the full functionality of 
the viewers, including printing, save image to file, cut and paste from tables,
etc.  The cut and past from table views should work out of the box.  Some
options will need to be added to support save to file and printing.


NOTE: The basic functionality of the classes can be tested by putting the
jar files and jogl.jar on your CLASSPATH and typing:

java gov.anl.ipns.ViewTools.Displays.Display1D

java gov.anl.ipns.ViewTools.Displays.Display2D

java gov.anl.ipns.ViewTools.Components.ThreeD.DetectorScene


The Display3D does not have a main test program, but some of the supporting 
components are exercised in the "DetectorScene" test program.
