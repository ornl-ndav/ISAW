/**
 * IBoundsList3D provides bounding information for three dimensional points.
 * Each element of IBoundsList3D will have an extension length for each 
 * direction in 3d space. The default values of the extensions should be zero,
 * making it a single point in space.
 * 
 * To orient the volume surrounding the point, two vectors are kept along
 * with the extension data. These vectors define the newly oriented x and y
 * axes (The third z axis can be calculated with cross product, and the three
 * new axes can be used to construct a transformation matrix). The
 * x, y, z extensions will expand in these user defined directions. 
 * The defaults values for the orientation should be <1,0,0> and
 * <0,1,0>, the normal x and y axes directions for right-handed coordinate
 * system.
 *
 * The implementation must define how values are added or given to the object.
 * 
 * As extensions are added to the array, information on the 
 * maximum and minimum extent values is kept. If a point is removed, the
 * method recalcMaxMinExtents() should be called to lineraly deterimine the
 * max and min extents. If no extentsion information is given on construction,
 * the max extents are set to zero and min extents are set to Float.MAX_VALUE.
