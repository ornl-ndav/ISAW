 *
 *  $Log$
 *  Revision 1.13  2007/05/10 20:55:43  dennis
 *  Now uses the Region.ClampPointsToArray() to restrict the points returned
 *  by getSelectedPoints() to lie in the array.
 *
 *  Revision 1.12  2007/04/28 19:47:26  dennis
 *  Expanded javadocs.
 *
 *  Revision 1.11  2007/04/07 21:23:58  dennis
 *  Removed two unused variables.
 *
 *  Revision 1.10  2007/03/16 16:48:36  dennis
 *  Major refactoring.  Now overides getSelectedPoints() to deterimine
 *  which point(s) this region should indicate as selected.  Removed
 *  initializeSelectedPoints() method that is no longer needed.  Removed
 *  getRegionBounds() method, since that is now taken care of in the
 *  base class using the world coordinate bounds.  Added getRegionBoundsWC().
 *
 *  Revision 1.9  2004/05/20 20:48:26  millermi
 *  - Constructor now initializes world and image bounds to
 *    the bounds of the defining points.
 *
 *  Revision 1.8  2004/05/20 17:02:26  millermi
 *  - Made method getRegionBounds() public so it may be used by
 *    outside classes.
 *
 *  Revision 1.7  2004/03/15 23:53:52  dennis
 *  Removed unused imports, after factoring out the View components,
 *  Math and other utils.
 *
 *  Revision 1.6  2004/03/12 02:10:21  rmikk
 *  changed package names
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2004/02/14 03:34:57  millermi
 *  - selectedpoints no longer includes point found off the image.
 *  - added toString() method.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2004/01/07 06:44:53  millermi
 *  - Added static method getRegionUnion() which removes duplicate
 *    points from one or more selections.
 *  - Added protected methods initializeSelectedPoints() and
 *    getRegionBounds(). Each is needed by getRegionUnion()
 *    to calculate a unique set of points.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2003/12/20 04:14:24  millermi
 *  - Cosmetic changes, made code more user friendly.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2003/10/22 20:27:58  millermi
 *  - Fixed java doc error.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2003/08/11 23:40:41  millermi
 *  - Initial Version - Used to pass region info from a
 *    ViewComponent to the viewer. WCRegion is an unrelated
 *    class that passes info from the overlay to the
 *    ViewComponent.
