 *  $Log: ElapsedTime.java,v $
 *  Revision 1.6  2006/05/01 19:24:29  dennis
 *  Now uses the newer high resolution timer, System.nanoTime(),
 *  to get a timing resolution of 20 microseconds or better,
 *  rather than the older System.currentTimeMillis() which had
 *  a timing resolution of at best 1 millisecond on Linux,
 *  and often had lower resolution on various Windwows systems.
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2004/03/15 23:53:49  dennis
 *  Removed unused imports, after factoring out the View components,
 *  Math and other utils.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2004/03/11 22:13:14  millermi
 *  - Changed package names and replaced SharedData with
 *    SharedMessages class.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2002/11/27 23:23:49  pfpeterson
