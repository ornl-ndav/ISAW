 *  Return an array containing a set of "Euler angles" representing a

 *  set of orthonormal basis vectors u,v,n.   Only the basis vectors u,v 
 *  are taken as arguments since the "n" vector is calculated internally 
 *  as u X v.  "v" is then recalculated as n X u, in case v was not originally
 *  perpendicular to "u".  All vectors will be normalized internally.
 *  The angles of rotation are to be applied as follows:
 *
 *  1. Rotate about the positive z-axis by phi
 *  2. Rotate about the positive x-axis by chi
 *  3. Rotate about the positive z-axis by omega
