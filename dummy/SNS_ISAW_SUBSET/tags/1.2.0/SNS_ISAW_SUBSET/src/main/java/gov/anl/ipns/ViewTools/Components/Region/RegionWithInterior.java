 * Modified:
 *
 *  $Log: RegionWithInterior.java,v $
 *  Revision 1.5  2007/06/15 22:41:20  oakgrovej
 *  added if else statement to catch an error
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2007/04/28 19:47:26  dennis
 *  Expanded javadocs.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2007/04/07 21:23:27  dennis
 *  Removed unused import.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2007/03/25 21:59:04  dennis
 *  Cleaned up getSelectedPoints() method.  Now calls getRegionBuonds()
 *  method to get the range of rows and columns covered, instead of
 *  getting the world coordinate bounds and mapping them to array
 *  coordinates.  Also, now uses an array to accumulate the selected
 *  points, instead of a vector, for efficiency.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2007/03/16 16:31:48  dennis
 *  New subclass of Region to deal with regions like box, wedge, circle,
 *  etc. that have an interior, as opposed to regions like line and point
 *  that don't have an interior.  All regions with interior are now handled
 *  uniformly using a method to determine whether or not a point is in
 *  the region, in world coordinates.

 * elements are inside the region by stepping over all disrete elements in

 * to world coordinates, and checking whether or not the centers fall in 
 * the region.
