 *  Revision 1.3  2007/08/14 00:03:33  dennis
 *  Major update to JSR231 based version from UW-Stout repository.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2006/09/05 01:43:33  dennis
 *  Updated to use System.nanoTime() instead of System.currentTimMillis,
 *  to get more accurate timing for short time intervals.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2004/12/13 05:02:27  dennis
 *  Minor fix to documentation
