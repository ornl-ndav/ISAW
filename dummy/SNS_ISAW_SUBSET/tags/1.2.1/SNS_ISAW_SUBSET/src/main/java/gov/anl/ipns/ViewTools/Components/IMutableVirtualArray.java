 * New interfaces that define the methods for altering the values
 * in a VirtualArray.  These methods were previously part of the
 * IVirtualArray interfaces.  The mutator methods are now being
 * factored out of the IVirtualArray classes, so that the values
 * in an IVirtualArray class are not changeable.  This change has
 * a number of advantages.
 * 1. The basic IVirtualArray concept was intended for passing
 *    information to viewers.  The viewers should not alter the
 *    data, so we now remove methods that could be used to alter
 *    data.
 * 2. The intention was to implement the IVirtualArray concept with
 *    classes that "extract" a regular grid of values from an
 *    underlying more complicated data structure.  It makes no
 *    sense to set values in that context, and it was previously
 *    necessary to include "stub" methods for the mutator methods.
 * 3. Using an immutable virtual array saves memory in the following
 *    way.  A virtual array can be wrapped around a DataSet and the
 *    values used from the underlying DataSet tables of values.
 *    Since the interface doesn't provide mutator methods, there
 *    is no need to make copies of the data.
