/**
 * This interface extends the ISparseArray3D and IBoundsList3D interfaces 
 * to add information about each point's three dimensional volume surrounding
 * the point. 
 * 
 * For each scattered point in the array, IPhysicalArray3D will hold an 
 * extension width for each direction in 3d space.  The point will be
 * the center of each extent, making it the center of a rectangular
 * prism. The intial values of the extensions will be set to zero
 * (making it a single point in space) if extent data is not given to the
 * constructor.
 * 
 * To orient the volume surrounding the point, two vectors are kept along
 * with the extension data. These vectors define the "rotated" x and y
 * axes (The third z axis will be calculated with cross product). The
 * x, y, z extensions will expand in these user defined directions. 
 * The intial values for the orientation will be set to <1,0,0> and
 * <0,1,0> (the normal x and y axes directions) if orientation data is not
 * given to the constructor. 
 * 
 * As extensions are set in the array, information on the 
 * maximum and minimum extent values is kept and the maximum
 * and minimum area for the entire 3D volume (point + exents). If
 * bound data is reset and the max and min edges change, the method
 * recalcMaxMinEdges() should be called to linearly determine the volume edges.
 * This allows the user of the array to define a 3d volume
 * large enough to accommodate all the rectangular prisms. 
 * 
 * It is assumed that none of the volumes will overlap, ie the
 * extensions of one point will not go into the extension of 
 * another point.
