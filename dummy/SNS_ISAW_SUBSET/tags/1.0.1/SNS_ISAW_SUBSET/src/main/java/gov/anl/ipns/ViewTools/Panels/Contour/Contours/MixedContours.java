 * Modified:
 * $Log: MixedContours.java,v $
 * Revision 1.5  2005/07/12 16:36:04  kramer
 *
 * Made this class an abstract class and now the classes OrderedContours and
 * NonUniformContours extend this class (previously, these two classes were
 * encapsulated in this class).  This was done so that the methods for the
 * IPreserveState interface could be implemented specifically by the
 * subclasses of this class.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2005/06/28 16:18:46  kramer
 *
 * Modified to use the new getLowestLevel() and getHighestLevel() methods
 * from the Contours class.  Also, the constructors have been modified so
 * that the only constructor is one that takes both a
 * UniformContours and NonUniformContours object.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2005/06/22 22:27:52  kramer
 *
 * Rearranged the code so that the old code is in an inner class called
 * UnorderedContours.  Also, a new inner class called OrderedContours
 * was crated.  Now when an object of this type is created the option to
 * order the contour levels must be given and the corresponding inner class
 * will be used.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/06/08 22:10:57  kramer
 *
 * Modified the constructors to only have UniformContours and/or
 * NonUniformContours objects as parameters and added new javadocs.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/06/08 17:27:18  kramer
 *
 * This class represents a union of UniformContours and NonUniformContours
 * in that it holds a collection of uniformly spaced contour levels in
 * addition to a collection of manually specified contour levels.
