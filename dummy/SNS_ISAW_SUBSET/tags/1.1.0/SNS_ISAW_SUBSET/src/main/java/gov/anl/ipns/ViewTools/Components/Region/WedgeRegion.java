 *  $Log: WedgeRegion.java,v $
 *  Revision 1.23  2007/07/30 14:30:33  dennis
 *  The originally specified defining points are now modified to
 *  enforce symmetry.  Since the originaly defining points are
 *  typically obtained by transforming pixel locations (integer
 *  coordinates on a grid) to WorldCoordinates, symmetry conditions
 *  are often violated.  The constructor now adjusts the positions
 *  of the defining points (except for the center point) as needed
 *  to preserve symmetry.  This fixes a bug where a region would
 *  not seem to be constructed properly and would have a slightly
 *  different boundary after being drawn by a region editior.
 *
 *  Revision 1.22  2007/07/05 00:17:24  dennis
 *  Fixed error in comment.
 *
 *  Revision 1.21  2007/03/16 16:57:56  dennis
 *  Major refactoring.  This class is now derived from the
 *  RegionWithInterior class.  The getSelectedPoints() method is
 *  implemented uniformly in the base class, RegionWithInterior.
 *  This is a major simplification.  The key method is the
 *  isInsideWC(x,y) that determines which world coordinate points
 *  are inside the region, and getRegionBoundsWC() that provides
 *  a bounding rectangle for this region in world coordinates.
 *  Removed initializeSelectedPoints() method that is no longer
 *  needed.
 *
 *  Revision 1.20  2005/01/18 22:59:00  millermi
 *  - Fixed gramatical error in comments.
 *
 *  Revision 1.19  2004/05/20 20:48:27  millermi
 *  - Constructor now initializes world and image bounds to
 *    the bounds of the defining points.
 *
 *  Revision 1.18  2004/05/20 17:02:27  millermi
 *  - Made method getRegionBounds() public so it may be used by
 *    outside classes.
 *
 *  Revision 1.17  2004/05/11 01:30:48  millermi
 *  - Removed unused variables.
 *  - Removed commented code which made line selections part of the
 *    wedge region.
 *
 *  Revision 1.16  2004/03/15 23:53:52  dennis
 *  Removed unused imports, after factoring out the View components,
 *  Math and other utils.
 *
 *  Revision 1.15  2004/03/12 02:07:45  rmikk
 *  Fixed package names
 *
 *  Revision 1.14  2004/03/09 17:23:11  millermi
 *  - Overload getDefiningPoints() from base class. This fixes
 *    bug that converted angles to image coordinates.
 *
 *  Revision 1.13  2004/02/17 01:57:52  millermi
 *  - Removed LineRegions which selected points on the boundry of the
 *    wedge. This fixes a bug that causes an index out of bounds
 *    exception found by Alok.
 *
 *  Revision 1.12  2004/02/14 03:34:57  millermi
 *  - selectedpoints no longer includes point found off the image.
 *  - added toString() method.
 *
 *  Revision 1.11  2004/01/07 06:44:53  millermi
 *  - Added static method getRegionUnion() which removes duplicate
 *    points from one or more selections.
 *  - Added protected methods initializeSelectedPoints() and
 *    getRegionBounds(). Each is needed by getRegionUnion()
 *    to calculate a unique set of points.
 *
 *  Revision 1.10  2003/12/23 18:41:53  millermi
 *  - Added adjustments to p1 and rp1 so the LineRegion is
 *    closer to the rest of the wedge.
 *  - Improved selection capability.
 *
 *  Revision 1.9  2003/12/20 05:42:25  millermi
 *  - Now corrects the topleft/bottomright defining points if
 *    they were scaled incorrectly by the image.
 *
 *  Revision 1.8  2003/12/20 04:15:59  millermi
 *  - Included an off-by-one on the pointangle so that
 *    border points are always included. This eleviates
 *    "holes" in the wedge.
 *
 *  Revision 1.7  2003/12/18 22:38:00  millermi
 *  - Tweaked how x/yextent are calculated. Now must have a different
 *    of more than one to be reset.
 *
 *  Revision 1.6  2003/12/16 01:42:24  millermi
 *  - made pointchecker protected variable so it could be
 *    used by the DoubleWedgeCursor.
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2003/12/13 01:16:03  millermi
 *  - Lines bounding wedge now use the LineRegion class
 *    to find all points on the boundary consistently.
 *  - Fixed bug that distorted the wedge when near the
 *    border of the image.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2003/12/12 06:11:44  millermi
 *  - Completely renovated how the points are selected.
 *    Previously slope was used to restrict points, now
 *    the angle of the point is calculated and compared
 *    with the starting/ending angles of the arc.
 *  - This class now assumes the arc will be drawn
 *    counterclockwise, so the starting angle may be
 *    larger than the stopping angle if the 4th to
 *    1st quadrant selection is made.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2003/10/22 20:26:09  millermi
 *  - Fixed java doc errors.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2003/08/21 22:41:08  millermi
 *  - Commented out debug statements and removed out code
 *    that was commented out.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2003/08/21 18:21:36  millermi
 *  - Initial Version - uses equation for ellipse and slope of a line to
 *    determine if a point is in the region.

/**
 * This class is a specific region designated by three points.
 * The WedgeRegion is used to pass points selected by a
 * wedge region (in SelectionOverlay) from the view component
 * to the viewer. Given the defining points of a region,
 * this class can return all of the points inside the selected region. 
 * The defining points of the wedge are:
 * 
 * p[0]   = center pt of circle that arc is taken from
 * p[1]   = last mouse point/point at intersection of line and arc
 * p[2]   = reflection of p[1]
 * p[3]   = top left corner of bounding box around arc's total circle
 * p[4]   = bottom right corner of bounding box around arc's circle
 * p[5].x = startangle, the directional vector in degrees
 * p[5].y = degrees covered by arc.
 *
 * The large number of defining points replaces the work of recalculating
 * information at each step of the region calculation. Like a EllipseRegion,
 * this region may appear to be circular, but may actually be elliptical.
