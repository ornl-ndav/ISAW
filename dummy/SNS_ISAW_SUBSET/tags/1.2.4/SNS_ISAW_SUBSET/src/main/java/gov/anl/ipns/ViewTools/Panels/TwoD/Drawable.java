/**
 * This class is an abstract base class for graphical objects that can
 * be drawn in a TwoD_JPanel.  This class includes convenience methods for 
 * setting the color, position and rotation angle for IDrawable objects.
 * NOTE: Transformations are used to changed the basic graphics coordinate
 * system so that the origin (0,0) is in the lower left hand corner of the
 * display, rather than in the upper right hand corner.  This effectively
 * changes from a default left-hand coordinate system to a default right 
 * hand coordinate system.  Derived classes for which the "handedness" 
 * is important, such as TextDrawable and ImageDrawable must include an 
 * additional transformation to correct the handedness.
