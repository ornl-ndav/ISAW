 *  $Log: TableRegion.java,v $
 *  Revision 1.4  2004/05/20 20:48:27  millermi
 *  - Constructor now initializes world and image bounds to
 *    the bounds of the defining points.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2004/05/20 17:02:27  millermi
 *  - Made method getRegionBounds() public so it may be used by
 *    outside classes.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2004/05/11 01:25:31  millermi
 *  - Changed javadoc comments.
 *  - Removed unused variables.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2004/05/09 16:59:56  millermi
 *  - Initial Version - This region provides support for regions
 *    selected using a table.
