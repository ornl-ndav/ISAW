 *
 * Modified:
 *  $Log: WedgeCursor.java,v $
 *  Revision 1.10  2007/07/30 14:31:41  dennis
 *  Minor javadoc fix.
 *
 *  Revision 1.9  2007/04/07 21:27:44  dennis
 *  Clean up of logic for selecting points that define the region.
 *
 *  Revision 1.8  2007/03/23 20:24:54  dennis
 *  Now calculates symmetrically placed points across axis of wedge
 *  using vectors, instead of slopes of lines that could become
 *  undefined.
 *
 *  Revision 1.7  2004/05/11 00:59:27  millermi
 *  - Removed unused variables.
 *
 *  Revision 1.6  2004/03/12 01:33:23  millermi
 *  - Changed package and imports.
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2003/12/12 20:04:40  millermi
 *  - Fixed bug that caused entire circle to be drawn.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2003/12/12 06:08:28  millermi
 *  - Reworked how arc was calculated.
 *  - Now progressing from start to stop of angle is always
 *    counterclockwise. This simplifies the work necessary
 *    for calculated the points selected by the region.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2003/12/11 17:11:23  millermi
 *  - Minor change so line is not redrawn while cursor stretches.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2003/09/02 21:08:10  millermi
 *  - Removed bounding rectangle from cursor.
 *  - Directional vector new is redrawn when the wedge is being
 *    drawn, thus causing the vector to disappear.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2003/08/21 18:19:46  millermi
 *  - Initial Version, allows for "pie slice" selection.
