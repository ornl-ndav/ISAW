 *  $Log: SceneFramesViewComponent.java,v $
 *  Revision 1.11  2007/08/21 20:25:47  dennis
 *  Now uses the setBackgroundColor method from the JoglPanel class.
 *  The background can now be changed.
 *
 *  Revision 1.10  2006/08/10 15:05:11  dennis
 *  Set default background color to a blue-gray, instead of black.
 *
 *  Revision 1.9  2006/07/25 04:33:18  dennis
 *  No longer sets the scene to null before rebuilding and setting a
 *  new scene.  This avoids null pointer exceptions if redraws are
 *  requested from another thread, when the new scene is being rebuilt,
 *  though it may require more memory.
 *  Now calls AttachComponentSizeListener() if it is using a lightweight
 *  GLJpanel, to rebuild display lists that are lost when the component
 *  is resized.
 *
 *  Revision 1.8  2006/07/25 03:05:25  dennis
 *  Now only creates the JoglPanel one time, rather than every
 *  time that dataChanged(array) is called.
 *
 *  Revision 1.7  2006/07/25 02:14:25  dennis
 *  Added constructor with "is_heavy" parameter to select whether
 *  to use a heavyweight GLCanvas or lightweight GLJpanel.
 *
 *  Revision 1.6  2006/07/21 14:15:11  dennis
 *  Now explicitly disables lighting, to work with the updated JoglPanel.
 *  Cleaned up some formatting problems caused by tabs.
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2005/08/04 22:36:46  cjones
 *  Updated documentation and comment header.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2005/07/29 20:52:50  cjones
 *  Multiple pixels can now be selected through either mouse clicks or
 *  a side control list.  A single click will select a single pixel and a
 *  double click will select the entire detector of pixels.  Holding shift
 *  while clicking will add selection to current selected pixels, while holding
 *  ctrl will remove the selection.
 *
 *  A ControlList has been added to the view controls that will display
 *  selected pixels, as well as give options for adding and removing
 *  selections.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2005/07/27 20:36:43  cjones
 *  Added menu item that allows the user to choose between different shapes
 *  for the pixels. Also, in frames view, user can change the time between
 *  frame steps.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2005/07/25 21:27:55  cjones
 *  Added support for MouseArcBall and a control checkbox to toggle it. Also,
 *  the value of the selected pixel is now displayed with the Pixel Info, and
 *  updates on frame changes.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2005/07/22 19:45:13  cjones
 *  Separated 3D components into one base object and two functional objects,
 *  one for data with frames and one for data without frames. Also, added 
 *  features and tweaked functionality.

/**
 * This object displays data in a three dimensional viewer. Data is given as an 
 * array of IPhysicalArray3DList objects. Each data point has a list of 
 * associated values,
 * which are used to color the point using a log scaled color model. The 
 * positions, extents, and orientations give each point its place and shape 
 * in space.  The user
 * may select three different shapes: a box, a rectangle, or a dot.  The
 * box gives the most accurate representation of the data, but it may exhibit
 * low frame rendering with large datasets. The other two shapes can increase
 * performance but are less accurate to the true representation of the 
 * detectors.
 * 
 * Several controls allow the user to adjust the camera, change the pixel 
 * colors, change
 * the background color, change frames, see output from mouse clicks, and
 * a list of selected pixels.
 * 
 * On the selected pixel list, the proper input is to first put the 
 * detector ids that were assigned to the particular data array and 
 * then the pixel indices within that array.  To include multiple ids
 * on a line use a comma (',') to seperate individual nonconsecutive ids and
 * use a colon (':') to specifiy a range of ids.
 * Examples: 4 6
 *           4 5,8
 *           4 5,7,9:11
 * 
 * This component uses a JOGL (Java OpenGL) based panel to render the scene.
