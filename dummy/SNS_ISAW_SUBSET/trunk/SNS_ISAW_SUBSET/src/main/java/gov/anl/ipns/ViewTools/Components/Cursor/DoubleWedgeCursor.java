 * Modified:
 *
 *  $Log: DoubleWedgeCursor.java,v $
 *  Revision 1.6  2007/03/23 20:26:56  dennis
 *  Now extends WedgeCursor, so all drawing and delicate calculations
 *  already done in WedgeCursor are not repeated here.  The second
 *  wedge is drawn by reflection points across the center point and
 *  calling the code to draw the single Wedge.
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2004/05/11 00:56:15  millermi
 *  - Removed unused variables.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2004/03/12 01:33:22  millermi
 *  - Changed package and imports.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2003/12/16 01:43:41  millermi
 *  - Restructured selection so parameters define region
 *    in a counterclockwise direction.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2003/09/02 21:08:10  millermi
 *  - Removed bounding rectangle from cursor.
 *  - Directional vector new is redrawn when the wedge is being
 *    drawn, thus causing the vector to disappear.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2003/08/26 03:38:58  millermi
 *  - Initial Version - Makes rubberband cursor in the shape of a symmetric
 *    double wedge.
