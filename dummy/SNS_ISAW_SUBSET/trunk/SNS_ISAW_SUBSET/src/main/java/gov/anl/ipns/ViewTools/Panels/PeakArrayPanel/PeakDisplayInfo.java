   *  Construct a PeakDisplayInfo object using the specified "small" array of
   *  counts, presumably extracted from some larger 3D array of data.
   *  NOTE: The array of counts must be indexed as counts[page][row][col].
   *        That is, it is a list of two dimensional arrays of the same size
   *        and each two dimensional array is stored in row major order.
   *  NOTE: The array of counts must have an odd number of rows, columns and
   *        pages, and must be centered on the center of the peak.
   *  NOTE: Although this array has row, col, channel indexes starting at 
   *        (0, 0, 0) the data is assumed to be extracted from a larger array.
   *        Consequently the min_row, min_col and min_channel where this 
   *        data was taken from also is needed.
   *  NOTE: Row 0 will be displayed at the BOTTOM of the image.
   *
   *  @param name      Name that will be displayed on a titled border around
   *                   the image of one slice from the counts array.  This
   *                   should include the sequence number, and col, row,
   *                   channel of the peak center.
   *  @param counts    A 3D array of floats, containing the portion of a 
   *                   larger array, that is centered on a peak.  This class
   *                   keeps a REFERENCE to the counts[][][] array that is 
   *                   passed in.
   *  @param min_row   Minimum row number in the array where counts[][][]
   *                   was extracted.
   *  @param min_col   Minimum column number in the array where counts[][][]
   *                   was extracted.
   *  @param min_chan  Minimum channel number in the array where counts[][][]
   *                   was extracted.
   *  @param is_valid  Flag indicating whether or not this peak is considered
   *                   valid.  If false, the border text will be drawn in
   *                   RED
