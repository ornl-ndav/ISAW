 * Modified:
 *
 *  $Log: PerspectiveCamera.java,v $
 *  Revision 1.4  2007/08/14 00:03:27  dennis
 *  Major update to JSR231 based version from UW-Stout repository.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2006/08/04 02:16:21  dennis
 *  Updated to work with JSR-231, 1.0 beta 5,
 *  instead of jogl 1.1.1.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2005/10/14 03:46:47  dennis
 *  Updated from current version kept in CVS at IPNS.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2005/07/18 18:39:44  dennis
 *  Added a copy constructor to initialize the camera values from
 *  another camera.  Added getLineOfSight() method that finds a
 *  ray in world coordinatates, starting at a point on the front
 *  clipping plane, pointing in the direction of a line of sight,
 *  given the pixel coordinates (x,y) of a point on the display
 *  window, and the size of the window in pixels.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2004/10/25 21:59:20  dennis
 *  Added to SSG_Tools CVS repository
 *
 *
 *   10/25/04  MakeProjectionMatrix no longer sets the matrix mode to 
 *             GL_PROJECTION and loads the identity.  This must now be
 *             done before calling MakeProjectionMatrix.  This change
 *             was needed so that a call to GLU.gluPickMatrix() could 
 *             be inserted BEFORE making the projection matrix, when 
 *             doing picking.
