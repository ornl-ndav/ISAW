 *
 *  2008/08/21  Updated to latest version from UW-Stout repository.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2007/11/18 01:51:20  dennis
 *  Split method DollyInXZ_Plane into two methods.  The new version,
 *  DollyInXZ_Plane_1() only moves in and out of the scene.  Lateral
 *  moves of the mouse have no effect.  This seems less confusion to
 *  use than the original version, now called DollyInXZ_Plane_2().
 *  The original version moved both in and out of the scene and
 *  moved laterally within the scene.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2006/12/11 04:33:15  dennis
 *  Added methods DollyInXZ_Plane(), DollyInYU_Plane() and
 *  LookUpDownLeftRight() to support the MouseWalkView control.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2005/10/14 04:00:28  dennis
 *  Moved into local CVS repository, from CVS repository at IPNS.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2005/08/03 16:50:04  dennis
 *  ArcBall method now reverts to ad_hoc_ArcBall in another case.
 *  The calculation of the angle of rotation using arccos(dot_prod/norms)
 *  would occasionally fail when the dot_prod/norms was essentially 1.
 *  Rounding errors would lead to 1.0000001, and the arccos would
 *  return NaN.  In this case, ad_hoc_ArcBall will now be used instead.
 *  Also made some minor additions to the java docs.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2005/08/02 14:46:01  dennis
 *  Removed unused imports.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2005/07/25 15:31:05  dennis
 *  Collection of staic methods to support "ArcBall" behaviour, panning
 *  and "dollying" in/out.  These methods can be called in response to
 *  mouse events, keyboard events, etc. to control the view in the specified
 *  panel.
