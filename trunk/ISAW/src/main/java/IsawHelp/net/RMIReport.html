Report on using Java RMI to activate Operators remotely<br><br>

<center><font size=+2><b>OVERVIEW</b></center></font>
RMI stands for Remote Method Invocation, and is usually used for distributed
computing.
RMI can (essentially) be used to treat remote objects and methods as if they
were local. I say essentially because what the rmic compiler actually does is
create skeletons and stubs for communication with the client.  A stub is a
class passed to a client, through which a client requests objects and makes
method calls.  The server uses the skeletons to communicate with the actual
classes and handles the requests from the client.  The client then uses 
Naming.lookup() to get the stub from the server and work with it.  
From what I have seen so
far, it appears that both the skeletons/stubs and actual classes must reside in
the same directory.  I am looking into this, to see if it is possible to do
otherwise.
<p>
Creating an RMI application is fairly simple in concept.  You define an
interface, implement that interface in a remote class, and use the rmic
compiler to generate skeletons and stubs.  Then you start the 
<code>rmiregistry</code>.  Finally you start the RMI server.  Everything is
dependent upon the client being able to access the remote classes through the
server.  I have currently only tried setting this up through the local
loopback, since I thought it more important to get RMI working for us than to
learn how to set up an HTTP server on my machine.

<br><br><p>
<center><font size=+2><b>ISAW IMPLEMENTATION</b></center></font>
One RMI tutorial ( 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/rmi/overview.html">
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/rmi/overview.html</a> )
that I saw used the concept of a remote Compute class, to
which a client would send some computationally intensive Task (in this case, 
the task was to compute pi).  This seemed to mesh fairly well with what we 
want to accomplish: having the remote computer execute
getResult() using remote data.  After some modification of the files that were
given in the example, I was left with the following classes and interfaces:
<br><br>
<ul><li>IROperator.java.  This is the interface "Task" that the client 
object will implement.  The server accesses this interface.  This interface 
extends Serializable.</li>
<li>IOperatorEngine.java.  This is the interface that a client accesses in
order to perform the computation.</li>
<li>OperatorEngine.java.  This is the implementation of IOperatorEngine, and 
it resides on the server.</li>
<li>PiCalculator.java.  This class implements IROperator.java, extends 
GenericCalculator, and is used to 
compute pi.  This resides on the client.</li>
<li>ComputePi.java.  This is used by the client to call the 
OperatorEngine&#8217;s executeOperator(IROperator) method.  This class resides
on the client.</li></ul>

<br><br>I also had to implement Serializable on StringFilterer.java and 
IParameterGUI.java.  I placed the code for building the client classes, the 
public server classes, running the rmic compiler, starting the client, and 
starting the server in separate shell scripts.

<br><br><p>
<center><font size=+2><b>TESTING IT OUT</b></center></font>
<br><br>You should have received an OperatorRMI.zip file.  This contains all 
the source code and policy files necessary to work with.  
<br>
<ol>
<li>Open three separate shells</li>
<li>Backup your ISAW directory (especially if you don&#8217;t have CVS
access.  Unpacking the tarball will modify some of your files).</li>
<li>Create $HOME/ISAW/DataSetTools/operator/RMI/</li>
<li>Create $HOME/ISAW/DataSetTools/operator/RMITest/</li>
<li>Create $HOME/public_html/myclasses</li>
<li>cd over the $HOME/ISAW/
<li>Unpack the zip file in the ISAW directory</li>
<li>Run buildPublicClasses, buildRMIClasses, and buildClientClasses (or type 
in their text on the command line) in the ISAW directory</li>
<li>Type export CLASSPATH="" in the first shell, and type rmiregistry</li>
<li>Type startRMIServer in the second shell</li>
<li>Type executeClient in the last shell</li>
</ol><br><br>
These classes are still essentially the same as the ones from Sun&#8217;s
website.  The original classes are copyright Sun Microsystems.  
However, this was a tutorial, and I believe that I have modified their original 
classes enough that we can use the IROperator interface, the IOperatorEngine, 
the OperatorEngine, and ComputePi.  I doubt that we should use the PiCalculator,
since 95% of that code was written by the article&#8217;s author.  At any rate, 
do not put these classes in CVS yet.

<center><font size=+2><b>GENERAL THINGS TO NOTE ABOUT RMI</b>
</center></font>
<ul><li>Normally an RMI object exists all the time when the server is running.
To get it to activate on command, the Activatable class (JDK 1.2 and later)
needs to be used.  I have not tried this yet.</li>
<li>RMI uses HTTP protocols to serve up remote classes.  In general, a 
lightweight HTTP server needs to be used to serve up the
remote classes.  One can be had at 
<a href="ftp://ftp.javasoft.com/pub/jdk1.1/rmi/class-server.zip">
ftp://ftp.javasoft.com/pub/jdk1.1/rmi/class-server.zip</a>.
</li>
<li>The remote classes that reside on the server need to be placed in a 
publicly accessible directory.  One such common directory is 
$HOME/public_html/classes/.  The same thing applies to the client if it needs
to pass objects to the server (which it does, in our case).</li>
<li>The directory where the remote classes reside (public_html/classes/) as
well as the development directory (e.g. ISAW/DataSetTools/operator/Generic/)
need to be in the server&#8217;s classpath.  This is because the server receives
calls from the client stub, and must access the actual objects in the 
development directory.</li>
<li>The rmiregistry service needs to be started in a shell with no CLASSPATH 
specified, or no CLASSPATH which holds the remote classes.  Otherwise, it will 
not properly register the remote objects, and the client will not be able to 
access them.</li>
<li>Unlike locally executed java code, the remote objects MUST be accessed
through the interface that is specified.  In other words, if a remote
object&#8217;s interface only specifies getResult() as a method, only
getResult can be accessed remotely.  Again, this is due to the skeleton/stub
access method.</li>
<li>The registry is typically only used to lookup the first remote object.
After that, the first remote object helps to find other remote objects.  I do
not believe, however, that this is something we need to worry about when
coding.</li>
<li>RMI&#8217;s transportation layer (normally TCP/IP) can be changed.
</ul>
<br><br><p>
<b>IMPLEMENTATION NOTES</b>
<li>When creating the remote object in main, you must refer to it using the
interface&#8217;s name.  This is because the server will return a stub for
accessing the remote methods, and they can only be referred to through the
interface.</li>
</ul>
