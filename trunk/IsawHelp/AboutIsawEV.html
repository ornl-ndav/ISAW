<P>IsawEV uses the Java binding for OpenGL (JOGL) to access OpenGL hardware for
graphics acceleration.  It pushes the graphics hardware fairly hard, potentially
drawing millions of points many times a second.  Consequently, this application
will NOT run well over the network, and is best used locally on a system with
OpenGL hardware.
