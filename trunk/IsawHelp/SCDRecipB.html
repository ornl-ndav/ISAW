       <li> <u>Plane 1</u> information is calculated when the a*&lt;->b* Slice
            button is pressed. This plane is determined by the points selected
            for the origin, a*, and b*.<P>
            
       <li><u>Plane 2</u> information is calculated when the b*&lt;->c* Slice
           button is pressed. This plane is determined by the points selected 
           for the origin, b*, and c*.<P>
            
       <li><u>Plane 3</u> information is calculated when the c*&lt;->a* Slice 
            button is pressed. This plane is determined by the points selected 
            for the origin, a*, and c*.<P>
            
       <li> <B>NOTE:</B> Need at least  <U><B>3 NON-PARALLEL PLANES</B></u> with 
          <U><B>3 NON-COPLANAR NORMAL DIRECTIONS</B></U> to get a UB matrix.<BR>

       <li><u>Distance control</u>: Moves the display closer/farther from the
          center. This seems to have to be moved at first to get any display<P>
           
       <li> <u>Azimuthal control</u>: Rotates the display around the vertical
           ( Fixed and blue) axis<P>
            
       <li> <u>Altitude control</u>: Rotates the display around the line from 
            the center pointing to the right.<P>
          
       <li><B><U>NOTE:</U></B> The azimuthal and altitude controls are used to 
           align the peaks on lines in the display. These <I>lines of peaks 
           usually define a plane</I>, since usually these points are not all
           on one line.

       <li> Clicking on <U>a Peak</U> in the display will set Qxyz information
            box.<P>
            
       <li> Clicking on the <U>origin</U> will replace the origin by the 
            contents in the Qxyz information box.<P>
           
       <li> Clicking on the <U>a*(+)</U>  ,<U>b*(*)</U> , or <U>c*(X)</U> 
            buttons will transfer the contents of the Qxyz point with the
            origin subtracted to the corresponding positions.<BR>
            NOTE: a*,b* and c* are directions. The program automatically 
            converts to and from directions to points where necessary.<P>
          
       <li> Clicking on the <U>a*&lt;->b* Slice</U> , <U>b*&lt;->c* Slice</U> , 
            and the <U>c*&lt;->a* Slice</U> will define planes as indicated <
            a href="#Planes">above</a>. The points of the plane will be marked 
             so it is possible to determine the planes that have already been 
             selected. If the mark is a "+" this is the a*b* plane. If the mark
              is a "*", it is the b*c* plane and if the mark is a "X" it is the 
              c*a* plane.<P>
              
       <LI> <U>RIGHT CLICKING a PEAK</U>(Button3 in Windows is right click)

       <LI><a name="editPlanes"></a> NOTE: Clicking the mouse at a point with 
             no peak causes the Qxyz information box to be <B>undefined</B>. 
             Then clicking on the a*(+), b*(*), or c*(X) buttons will
             cause those to become undefined( and the <B>marks disappear</B>).
             The Planes become <B>undefined( and marks disappear)</B> if 
             the corresponding origin,a*,b*, or c* values
             are undefined when a Slice button are pressed(Note: the display 
             may not be refreshed after such an operation).<P>
             
        <LI> A new plane is not parallel to the others if at least one of the 
            three plane marks are not on the same line.  3 distinct planes 
            should be selected.<P>

        <li> Use the azimuthal and altitude controls to get the <U>peaks 
             aligned</U> into parallel lines.<P>
             
        <li> Select one line and pick a point at the center. Then click the 
             <U>origin/Select</U> button.<P>
             
        <li> Select another point on the line a ways away from the first point.
             Then press the <U>a*(+)</U> Select button.<P>
             
        <li> Now rotate the display a bit to find points behind the front 
             points( use the azimuthal and altitude controls). Pick a point and
             press the <U>b*(*)</U> Select button.<BR>
             
             Check and make sure the three points are not collinear or close to
              collinear. Use the azimuthal and altitude controls to look at the 
              three points at different angles.<P>
              
        <LI> Press the b*(*) Select button then press the <U>a*&lt;->b* Slice
             </U> button.<P>
        
        <li> <U>Clear</U> out the origin, a*,and b* values and their displays
             by clicking at a point in the display so the Qxyz information box
             says undefined. Then click the origin, a*, and b* Select
             button.<P>
             
        <LI> <U>Repeat</U> steps 1 through 6 with another alignment of peaks.
            Make sure that the marks from the a*&lt;->b* Slice button are 
            <u>NOT all on the same line</u> in this display. Put the points in 
            the origin,b*(*), and c*(X) positions and press the b*&lt;->c* 
            Slice button.<P>
            
         <LI> Repeat steps 1 through 6 with another alignment of peaks. Here 
             make sure the marks for each selected plane do NOT lie on the
