<H1><Center> D-Viewer and Q-Viewer from IsawEV</Center></H1>

  These viewers show histograms of the d values or q values associated with the events from an experiment at SNS. 
They also have the ability to normalize these graphs for comparison purposes, and also,compare with other graphs 
 saved with very similar settings.

   When IsawEV is running, press <B>Additional Views</B> in the main panel.<P>

   In the Additional View Panel, press the checkbox to the left of <I><U> Show D Graph</u></I> or 
     <I><U> Show Q Graph</u></I>. Both or neither can be checked.<P><P>

   There is a time lag in changes to these views so that these views can work with the live data.<P>

   To <B>REMOVE</B> these views, unmark the associated checkbox in the <B>Additional Views</B> panel or just
       click the "x" in the upper right corner of the frame with the view.<P>

   Mark the <I><U>Use Log Scale</U></I> checkbox to have the histogram binned logarithmically. Changing this mark
     will cause all previous data needed for the D-Viewer and Q-Viewer to be lost. For Live Data, this means that
     these graphs will represent only the events that occurred after the checkbox was changed. If the data was loaded
     in from a file, you must reload the file from the start.

             IsawEV by loading in a Vanadium run, viewing the d or q graph, and saving these for later use.

    These Views work with live data. Normalization using Protons on target, though is a little more complicated.<P>
    To allow for normalization using Protons on Target or the other options below:
    <UL> In the file IsawProps.dat( in your home directory) include the following line:<P>
         <LI>ScaleWith=Protons on target<P>
