  The Wizards are meant as a tool to bridge the gap between analyzing data
  using the ISAW program, which is a fully flexible analysis, and analyzing
  data using scripts, which are fast but only run sequentially.<br><br>
  The Wizards allow you to perform predetermined steps one at a time, view
  intermediate results, and go back to change and/or optimize inputs in a
  previous step.

  <OL>The ISAW Wizards can be invoked in several manners
     <LI> IsawGUI.Isaw has links to several of these wizards under Wizards on the
        menu bar. Just click the appropriate menu item.
      <LI> <UL>From a command prompt as follows:
           <LI> open a command prompt to run the wizards. 
           <LI>  Set your classpath to run the Wizards.<BR>
              If you are running Isaw from the command line or Eclipse everything
              should be OK. <BR>
              If you run Isaw from IsawExec, look at the batch file. Find the line that
              starts with java -cp ****** . The **** to the next space should be the long 
              classpath that should follow the -cp in the commands below.
            </ul>
           <B>COMMAND</B>: java Wizard.TOF_SCD.InitialPeaksWizard_SNS1 <BR>
             if classpath is set up in the system<P>

           <B>COMMAND</B>: java -cp ***** Wizard.TOF_SCD.InitialPeaksWizard_SNS1 <BR>
             if classpath is not set up in the system<P>

       <li> From a copy of IsawExec.? where ? is bat or sh. In the copy, replace
            IsawGUI.Isaw by Wizard.TOF_SCD.InitialPeaksWizard_SNS1.<BR>
            <B>COMMAND</B>: InitPeaks

  <font size=+3>General use of the Wizards</font>
  </center>
  <hr>
  There are several ways to navigate through the Wizards.  The double arrow
  buttons move to the first step or the last step and the single arrows move
  one step forward or backward.<br><br>
  To execute an intermediate step, you can click on the "Do" button, and to
  execute all steps, you can click on the "Do All" button.  To view the results
  and parameters of the intermediate steps, you can select "View" from the menu
  bar then select the parameter you want to view.<br><br>
  To get help on the Wizard or a particular step, you can click on the "Help"
  option in the menu bar, then click on "On Wizard" or "On Current Form"
  respectively.<br><br>
  To save your progress, you can click on the "File" option in the menu bar,
  then click on "Save Wizard State", then type the file name that you want to
  save your progress to.  A ".wsf" extension is automatically appended to the
  name.  In a similar manner, you can load a previously saved Wizard using
  "File" then "Load Wizard State."<br><br>
  Clicking on "Reset" or "Reset All" will clear the progress bar for the
  current step or all steps, respectively.  This allows you to rerun one or
  more steps without changing any parameters.<br><br>
  To set a working or projects directory, select "Projects Directory" from the
  wizard menu, then simply select the directory you want.  The projects directory 
  will coerce the file browsers to initially open to your selected directory.

  <!-- Initial Peaks Wizard -->

  <font size=+3>SCD Initial Peaks Wizard</font>
  </center>
  <hr>
  This Wizard is meant to be used for an initial run to establish a baseline
  for further runs on the same sample.  There are six steps in this Wizard:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Finding peaks</li>
    <li>Establishing an initial orientation matrix</li>
    <li>Indexing the peaks</li>
    <li>Finding crystal geometry</li>
    <li>Refining the orientation matrix with a least squares routine.</li>
    <li>Reindexing peaks using the refined orientation matrix</li>
  </ol>
  The last step is optional, although typically multiple iterations are done
  over steps 5 and 6.
  <hr>

  <font size=+2>Description of steps and parameters</font>
  </center><P>
    The parameters and description for each step can be retrieved using the
    Form submenu option under the Help menu. <P>
