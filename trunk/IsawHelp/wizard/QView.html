   <H1><Center> Viewer of Peaks in Q Space(QViewer)</Center> </H1>
 This viewer allows for viewing peaks in Q space, moving them around, selecting peaks.
  Information handlers are available to show information on and image of data around  the 
  selected peak,and information on the rotation.<P>

  <UL>There are several<B><U> "cursor" modes</U></B><P>
     <LI> <I>Selectiong mode</I>  - allows for selecting peaks<P>
     <LI> <I>Rotation mode</I>    - allows for rotating peaks.  This is
             done by selecting a peak then dragging the peak<P>
     <LI> <I>Disable Mouse Mode</I> - mouse actions in this view are ignored<P>
  </ul><P>
  In this view, up is vertical, right is in the beam direction and vertical to right forms a 
   right handed system, so the usual third axis is back.  Unfortunately, in the rotation info,
   right is the 1st coordinate, up the 2nd and points in front of the plane have positive 3rd
   coordinates( 1st coordinate to 2nd coordinate is also a right hand system.<P>
