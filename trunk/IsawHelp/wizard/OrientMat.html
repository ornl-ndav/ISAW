This button presents options for creating orientation matrices, viewing various
aspects of the orientation matrix, and saving or loading the orientation matrix.

<UL><B> Creating Orientation Matrix Options </B><P>
   <LI> <U>Load Orientation Matrix</u>/ <U>Save Orientation Matrix</U>
        <UL> Can load in a matrix from another program or load one in that was
              saved previously</UL>
   <LI> <UL><U>Calculate Orientation Matrix</U> 
            <LI> <I>Automatic</I>- Uses an automatic method based on Rossman's algorithm if
                     no Crystal lattice parameters are present, otherwise an automatic
                     method starting with these parameters is used.<P>
            <LI> <I>From 4 Peaks</I>- Four <a href="PPeaks.html">peaks must be selected</a>. 
                      These must represent
                     four corners of a unit cell for the result to be meaningful.<P>
            <LI><I>From 2 Peaks with hkls</I> -The crystal parameters and tolerances along
                     with <a href="PPeaks.html">two peaks must be selected</a>. Optionally
                     their corresponding hkl values should also be specified.(If hkl values 
                       not set, all possible
                      ones are used).  This uses the Matrix program from Art Schultz that is
                      distributed with ISAW.<P>
            <LI> <I>From 3 Peaks with hkls</I>-<a href="PPeaks.html">Three peaks and their 
                      corresponding hkl values
                     must be selected</a>.  This will calculate the orientation matrix that will give
                     those three peaks the specified hkl values.  This matrix may have to be
                     Nigglified.<P>
            <LI> <I>Blind</I>- At least 4 peaks must be specified. This goes through the IPNS
                 Blind routine.
         </UL><P>
     <LI> <U>Show/Select Matrix from Set</U>-Some routines that calculate orientation matrices
             return a list of possible matrices. Use this option to see the LAST list created
             and select the desired one as the current orientation matrix
      </ul><P><P><HR>

  <UL><a href="QView.html#HighLight"><B> View in QViewer</B></a> -to see various aspects of 
              the orientation matrix in  the 3D view of the Peaks 
          of the peaks in Q space<P>
      <LI> <I>View Orientation Matrix</I>- The a*,b*, and c* vectors centered at the selected 
               point from the QViewer are displayed.<P>

      <LI> <I> View Plane Family a*b*</I>( a*c* or b*c*)-The family of planes containing the
              directions a* and b*(a* and c*,etc) with distance between planes determined by
              c*(b*,etc.) are drawn. Again, it is best to rotate the display to view these
              planes sideways in the view.<P>
      <LI>  <I> View Predicted Peaks</I>- The positions where peaks should have occurred are
               marked with a white box.<P>

     
 </UL><P><P><HR>

   <UL> <B> Utilities></B><I>Adjust Orientation Matrix</I><P>
       <LI> <I>Index Peaks</I>- This will index the peaks with the current orientation matrix.
              The tolerance will be asked for. NOTE: Index the peaks if you want to omit
              peaks, or optimize the orientation matrix.<P> 

       <LI> <I>Nigglify Orientation Matrix</I>-Some orientation matrices are not in standard 
              form. The non-experimentl Nigglify uses blind.<P> 

       <LI> <I>Optimize</I> Orientation Matrix- Optimizes the orientation matrix that has been
              indexed.<P> 

       <LI> Use the <a href="PFilter.html">Peak Filterer</a> to omit peaks. These will be
           omitted in the QViewer and not be  used in several automatic methods for calculating
           the orientation matrix.
