  ISAW Wizard Writing How-To

  What is a software Wizard?
  </font></center>
  <br><hr><br>
  For those of you not familiar with the concept of a software wizard, allow me
  to give you a brief story as an explanation.<br><br>
  
  Suppose that you want to create a resume for a job application, but you
  don&#8217;t know how to write a resume.  All you know is what name you want
  on the resume, what school(s) you received degrees from, and where you have
  worked the last few years.  If you use some software that allows you
  to type in that information and then creates a resume for you, you have just
  used a software wizard.<br>

  <br><hr><br>
  <font size=+2><center>
  How easy is it to create an ISAW Wizard?
  </font></center>
  <br><hr><br>
  ISAW Wizards&#8217; primary use is as a tool to allow you to analyze data 
  step-by-step.  You essentially decide what the steps will be by selecting 
  previously existing Operators or Scripts.  Both ISS and Jython scripts can be
  used.  All you really need to do is determine what parameters match up between 
  the steps and follow the template below, and you can easily create an ISAW 
  Wizard.
  <br><br>As you read, keep in mind that the steps will eventually translate
  into Wizard "Forms."

  <br><hr><br>
  <font size=+2><center>
  Step by Step directions for creating a Wizard.
  </font></center>
  <br><hr><br>
  <ol>
    <li>Decide what steps you want to perform.  That is, decide what analyses
    you want to do.</li><br>
    <li>Decide what order you want to do the analyses in.</li><br>
    <li>Determine your parameter "matches."  That is, determine what parameters 
    (such as runfile name) on the steps match up.  <br>For example, if you need
    a runfile name for both step 1 and step 4, that runfile name is a "match."
    <br><br><b> From the Wizard point of view, the result of executing an 
    Operator (i.e. what getResult(  ) returns) is also considered a 
    parameter.</b>
    </li><br>
    <li>Find or create the Operators or Scripts that correspond to your chosen
    steps.  Note that these will be placed into Forms.</li><br>
    <li>Locate the parameters in the Operators or Scripts that correspond to
    the "matches" you found in step 3.</li><br>
    <li>Write down the number of these parameters for each step.  Don&#8217;t
    forget that this is a zero based numbering system-the first parameter is
    parameter number zero and so on.
    <br><br><b>The parameter number for the result from getResult(  ) is exactly 
    the number of parameters for the Operator.</b>  For example, the result 
    parameter number for an Operator with 5 parameters is 5.
    </li><br>
    </li><br>
    <li>Create a table using the "Table Pattern" directions given
    below.</li><br>
    <li>Use the template given in "Wizard Template" below to create your
    Wizard.</li><br>
    <li>Test it out.  Remember that many results of intermediate steps (such as
    DataSets, result files, etc.) can be viewed directly from the Wizard using
    the "View" menu.</li><br>
  </ol>

  This is a modification of an actual Wizard, with heavy commenting so that you
  can understand what is going on.  Recall that each step is implemented with 
  either an Operator or Script, and that each Script or Operator is placed into
  a Form.<br><br></font>

  Table Pattern
  </font></center>
  <br><hr><br>

  Suppose that we have a Wizard with three steps: loading histograms, time
  focusing and grouping, and saving in GSAS format.  Let&#8217;s call these
  steps<br>
  <ol>
    <li>LoadHistograms</li>
    <li>TimeFocus</li>
    <li>SaveAsGSAS</li>
  </ol><br>
  We know that there are three Operators that can do these steps for us.  They
  are: <br>
  <ol>
    <li>LoadMultiHistogramsForm</li>
    <li>TimeFocusGroupForm</li>
    <li>SaveAsGSASForm</li>
  </ol>
  Suppose that you have determined what parameters (e.g. run numbers) that you
  want to match up.  Suppose further that you have looked at the documentation
  for these Operators and have determined that the parameters for these steps 
  match up as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>LoadHistograms parameter 5 = TimeFocus parameter 0</li><br>
    <li>TimeFocus parameter 61 = SaveAsGSAS parameter 0</li><br>
    <li>LoadHistograms parameter 6 = SaveAsGSAS parameter 1</li><br>
    <li>LoadHistograms parameter 0 =  parameter 2</li><br>
    <li>LoadHistograms parameter 2 = SaveAsGSAS parameter 3</li><br>
  </ul><br>
  Now, if we consider a table with the column numbering corresponding to the step
  numbering (i.e. row 1 = step 1), and consider each row as corresponding to a 
  parameter "match", we can set the table up easily.  For each column/step, find 
  the Operator parameter number for the "match" for that step, and place that
  number in the cell corresponding to the step column and parameter "match" row.
  <br>
  Note: if you have a step that does not have a parameter "match" with one or
  more of the other steps, put a -1 in its cell for the parameter "match" row.  
  <br><br>
  Following these rules for our example, we come up with the table below.
  <br><br>
  <pre>
    LoadHistograms   TimeFocus   SaveAsGSAS
   |---------------------------------------|
   |       5       |     0     |    -1     |
   |---------------------------------------|
   |      -1       |     61    |     0     |
   |---------------------------------------|
   |       6       |    -1     |     1     |
   |---------------------------------------|
   |       0       |    -1     |     2     |
   |---------------------------------------|
   |       2       |    -1     |     3     |
   |---------------------------------------|
  </pre><br><br>

  What this essentially does is "link" the parameters so that when the value of
  one parameter changes, the values of any parameters linked to it change as
  well.<br><br>
  This table in Java code will look like this:<br>
  <pre><code>
  int fpi[][] = { {5, 0, -1}, 
                  {-1, 61, 0}, 
                  {6, -1, 1}, 
                  {0, -1, 2}, 
                  {2, -1, 3} };
  </pre></code>
  
  <b>DON'T</b> put a row of -1's in the table.  There is no point to it.
  You are supposed to be matching up parameters, so matching no parameters 
  at all makes no sense.<br><br>
