This button allows for viewing/highlighting certain data in the 3D QViewer.

<UL> The items that can be viewed are<P>
   <LI> <B>Runs</B> -Each <a href="QView.html#HighLight">run number</a> will be displayed with a different color. If detectors
         are not being differentiated, each run will have exactly one color.<P>
   <LI> <B>Detectors</B>-Each <a href="QView.html#HighLight">detector</a> will be displayed with a different color. If runs
         are not being differentiated, each run will have exactly one color.<P>
   <LI> Peaks with given <a href="QView.html#HighLight"><B>sequence numbers</B></a>- 
                      These peaks will be colored white<P>
   <LI> <a name="Planes">A <B>Plane determined</B></a> by 3 selected peaks(points)- A plane throught the 3 q-values
          will be displayed. It is most useful to rotate these planes so they are
          sideways to the display.<P>

   <LI> A <B>Family of planes</B> determined by 4 selected peaks(points)- The first 3 peaks
         determine one plane. The 4th point determines the distance between the family of 
         parallel planes.<P>
   <LI> <B>Clear peaks</B> highlighted above<P>
