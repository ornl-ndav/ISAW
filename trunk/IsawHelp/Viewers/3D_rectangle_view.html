The 3D Rectangle Viewer Views only DataSets with rectangular detector panels.  This view is a LOT faster
than the older 3D View if the DataSet has only rectangular detectors.<P><P>

Most of options, controls, etc. match those for the <a href="3D_view.html">old 3D view<a>, except for the following:
<UL>
 
  Draw Groups, Draw Detector Segments are omitted since these were introduced to speed up the old 3D view.
</ul><P>

In addition, this view has an added button <B><U>Show Lattice</U></b> if the data set has an orientation matrix loaded.
Marks at the theoretical lattice points are displayed if the Show Lattice button is pressed( this button then says
Hide Lattice).
