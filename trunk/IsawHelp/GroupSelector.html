<center><H1> Group Selection Application </H1></Center>
 
  This application allows users to assign Group numbers to pixels in area detectors. 
The pixels can be defined graphically or by formula. The definitions are done 
sequentially, so the group associated with a  pixel is the last group that was assigned
to that given pixel.  There are very limited UNDO options.
<P>
The inputs to this program is either a NeXus filename or both a DetCal filename, containing
position information, and a bank filename, which maps NeXus pixel ID's to row, col, and detector.  
If the input is from a NeXus file, the y values for
each pixel are all summed to one value.  
<P>

<ol type="A">The application consists of three separate panels and two Menus.
<LI><UL> Command Panel:<P>
      <LI> Allows for assigning/removing groups for whole detectors.<P>
            <UL> Clicking the button <B>Assign to Group</b> or <b>Remove Group</b> after the information
                  in the textboxes under <U>Detector(s)</U> and <U>Group</u> have been filled out will: <P>
                  

                  <LI> <B>Remove Group</B> just assigns the indicated pixels the group number 0<P>

                  <LI> <B>Assign to Group</B> just assigns the pixels in the specified detectors 
                         the group number in the <U>Group</u> text box. <P>
                  <LI> If No detectors are given, all pixels in all detectors will be
                       assigned the given group number<P>
                  <LI><a href="#ChangeDetector">NOTE on setting Detector numbers</a>.<P>
             </ul>
            
      <LI> Allows for assigning groups for pixels satisfying a given formula<P>
            <ul> Click <B>Formual Assign</B> after the information under <U>Group</U> and the 
                  <U>Formula</u> in the text box to the right of <B>Formula</b> is filled out.<P>
                 <LI> The formula is in "jython". The variables( case sensitive) that can be used
                     are d, q, wl, row, col, det, pix and ang. "ang" is the scattering angle in degrees.<P>
                  <LI> d, q, wl represent these values at time =1000 micro seconds ONLY<P>
             </ul>
  
      <LI> If the data is loaded in from a NeXus file, there are buttons to <B>View Data</b> and
            <B>View Groups</b>. This changes the 3D View and 2D Detector Panel to show the Data or 
             show the Group information.

<li> <UL><a href="Viewers/3D1_view.html">ThreeD Detector View</a>: <P>

         <LI> This view contains controls to move the view around, display information
              about the last Pointed At Pixel which is displayed at the bottom of the Command Panel<P>

         <LI> When Viewing Group information, pixels assigned
              different groups will have different colors.  The assigned group appears 
              as the Group Num in the Pointed At Pixel information.<P>

       <LI> Selecting a pixel in this view will display information about that
           pixel in the "Pointed at Pixel" information display at the bottom of the Command Panel.<P>

       <LI> <a href="SelectionOverlay.html">The Selection overlay</a> can be used to select subregions of a detector.
            For the selected pixels to be assigned to a group, the name of a selector must be an 
            integer. This integer will be the group number assigned to the pixels associated with this
            selection when the <B>Set Selector Groups</b> button is pressed. If the 
                 <B>Clear Selector Groups</B> is pressed, these pixels will be assigned group number 0.<P>

             Selector Name[Integer]).<P>
