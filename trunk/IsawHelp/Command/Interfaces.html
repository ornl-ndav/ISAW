<h1><Center> Interfaces of CommandPane to other programs</Center></h1>
<ol Type ="A">
<li> Isaw<ul>
   This project was originally designed to integrate with Isaw.  Isaw has currently incorporated the CommandPane.<P>
   To send a data set to the Isaw program use the <A href ="ComDes.html#Send">Send </a> command.<P>
   TO BE DONE:<P>
<ul>   Isaw could let data sets from its tree be sent to the CommandPane.  See the addDataSet java Method
 </ul>
   </ul><P>
<li> Batch file
  <ul> These are currently supported. See <a href ="Examples.html#Batch1">Example</a><P>




  </ul><P>
<li> Macro- See <a href = "Grammer.html#Macro">Syntax</a> , and <a href = "Examples.html#Macro">Example</a>
  <ul> This has been implemented.  Currently to create and a macro:<ol type ="1">
      <li> Create the sequence of instructions in the CommandPane's Editor Pane or use any text editor.<P>
      <li> Make sure to use a lot of variables and assign them values at the top of the code<P>
      <li> Test the code and save it.<P>
      <li> Open the file in the CommandPane.<P>
      <li> Change the conents of the variables at the top<P>
      <li> Run this program<P>
      <li> Place the variable assignments at the top to the macro heading form
      </ol>
  </ul>
   So far? Macros can only be loaded and executed with ISAW<P>
<li> With stand alone program
   <ul>  <ol type = "1"> Stand alone programs can use several forms of CommandPane<P>
          <li> With the visual Elements<P>
          <li> Without the visual Elements<P>
          <li> Just the one line translator :execOneLine<P>
          <li> With a data set or data sets passed in at Construction time<P>
          <li> With a data set passed in using the addDataSet metnod<P>
         </ol>

  </ul><P>

<li> With javac
  <ul> Most low-level routines have been extracted and repackaged so that they can be used by javac.<P>
        javac can do the looping, if-then- else , etc. <ul>
           This would be faster and more extensible</ul><P>
       The routines are currently in the execOneLine class.

  </ul>

</ol>
