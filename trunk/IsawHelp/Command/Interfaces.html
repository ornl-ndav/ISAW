<h1><Center> Interfaces of CommandPane to other programs</Center></h1>
<ol Type ="A">
<li> Isaw<ul>
   This project was originally designed to integrate with Isaw.  Isaw has currently incorporated the CommandPane.<P>
   To send a data set to the Isaw program use the <A href ="ComDes.html#Send">Send </a> command.<P>
   
   </ul><P>
<li> Batch file
  <ul> These are currently supported. See <a href ="Examples1.html#Batch">Example</a>.<BR>
       The java program Command.ScriptOperator  can be used to run a script outside of ISAW and
        the command pane.  Include the script filename on the command line as the first argument.<P>




  </ul><P>
<li> Macro-simple
  <ul> A simple macro or a start on developing a macro or script with parameters:<ol type ="1">
      <li> Create the sequence of instructions in the CommandPane's Editor Pane or use any text editor.<P>
      <li> Make sure to use a lot of variables and assign them values at the top of the code<P>
      <li> Test the code and save it.<P>
      <li> Open the file in the CommandPane.<P>
      <li> Change the conents of the variables at the top<P>
      <li> Run this program<P>
      </ol> 
  </ul>
  Macros stored in a file can also be run, standalone, using the Command.ScriptOperator class. Invoke
  it as follows:<ul> java Command.ScriptOperator filename </ul><P>
<li> Macro with parameters. See <A href="Examples1.html#Parameters">Example</a>
  <ul> 
    A Macro or script with parameters can run in the CommandPane,in Isaw(File->Load Script), or supplying
    the filename as an argument to the Command.ScriptOperator class.  Variable names that represent 
    parameters are preceded by a "$", then
    followed by two "arguments" separated by spaces.  The first argument is the
   data type of the variable (immediately followed optionally by an initial value in
   parenthesis) and the third argument is a prompt that will 
   appear if a dialog box pops up requesting values for these parameters.<P>
<A  name="DataTypes">
   <OL> The parameter data types supported so far are
     <li> Integer or int, Float, DataSet, String , and Array (not case sensitive)
     <li> DataDirectoryString - Uses IsawProps.dat(property Data_Directory) to fill in a name
     <li> InstrumentNameString - Uses IsawProps.dat(property Default_Instrument) to fill in instrument name
     <li>DSSettableFieldString - Gives choices for  settable fields 
     <li> DSFieldString -Gives choice for fields that can be viewed
     <li> Choice( initValue) where initValue is a Script Array.  Creates a drop down choice box with the elements
           of the array.  The result is String 
     <li>LoadFileString- Will pop up an open file dialog box
     <li>SaveFileString -Will pop up a Save file dialog box
     <li>ServerTypeString- Will allow choice of a data server
     <li>SampleDataSet- Like DataSet but only Sample Data Sets will be selectable
     <li>MonitorDataSet- Like DataSet but only Monitor Data Sets will be selectable
     
   </ol>

  </ul><P>
<li> With stand alone program
   <ul>  <ol type = "1"> Stand alone programs can use several forms of CommandPane<P>
          <li> With the visual Elements<P>
          <li> Without the visual Elements<P>
          <li> Just the one line translator :execOneLine<P>
          <li> With a data set or data sets passed in at Construction time<P>
          <li> With a data set passed in using the addDataSet method<P>
          <li> The ScriptOperator class can execute a script.
         </ol>

  </ul><P>

<li> With javac
  <ul> Most low-level routines have been extracted and repackaged so that they can be used by javac.<P>
        javac can do the looping, if-then- else , etc. <ul>
           This would be faster and more extensible</ul><P>
       The routines are currently in the execOneLine class.

  </ul>
<li> Scripts are now "operators" and may be called by other scripts if installed.
 <ul> To install scripts, they must be placed in specific directories( relative to IsawProps.dat) and
 must have the extension ".iss".  <P>
     <li>Any script in the Scripts subdirectory of the ISAW subdirectory of the user's home directory are
     automatically installed.
     <li> Any script in the Scripts subdirectory of the directory specified by the GROUP_HOME property
         (set in the IsawProps.dat file) are automatically installed.
     <li> Finally, Any script in the Scripts subdirectory of the directory specified by the ISAW_HOME property
         (set in the IsawProps.dat file) are automatically installed.
  </ul>
</ol>
