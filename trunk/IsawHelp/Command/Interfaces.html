<h1><Center> Interfaces of CommandPane to other programs</Center></h1>
<ol Type ="A">
<li> Isaw<ul>
   This project was originally designed to integrate with Isaw.  Isaw has currently incorporated the CommandPane.<P>
   To send a data set to the Isaw program use the <A href ="ComDes.html#Send">Send </a> command.<P>
   
   </ul><P>
<li> Batch file
  <ul> These are currently supported. See <a href ="Examples1.html#Batch">Example</a><P>




  </ul><P>
<li> Macro-simple
  <ul> A simple macro or a start on developing a macro or script with parameters:<ol type ="1">
      <li> Create the sequence of instructions in the CommandPane's Editor Pane or use any text editor.<P>
      <li> Make sure to use a lot of variables and assign them values at the top of the code<P>
      <li> Test the code and save it.<P>
      <li> Open the file in the CommandPane.<P>
      <li> Change the conents of the variables at the top<P>
      <li> Run this program<P>
      </ol> 
  </ul><P>
<li> Macro with parameters. See <A href="Examples1.html#Parameters">Example</a>
  <ul> 
    A Macro or script with parameters can run in the CommandPane as well as in
    Isaw(File->Load Script).  Variable names that represent parameters are preceded by a "$", then
    followed by two "arguments" separated by spaces.  The first argument is the
   data type of the variable and the third argument is a prompt that will 
   appear if a dialog box pops up requesting values for these parameters.<P>
   <OL> The data types supported so far are
     <li> Integer or int, Float, DataSet, String , and Array (not case sensitive)
     <li> DataDirectoryString - Uses props.dat(property Data_Directory) to fill in a name
     <li> InstrumentNameString - Uses props.dat(property Default_Instrument) to fill in instrument name
     <li>DSSettableFieldString - Gives choices for  settable fields 
     <li> DSFieldString -Gives choice for fields that can be viewed
    
   </ol>

  </ul><P>
<li> With stand alone program
   <ul>  <ol type = "1"> Stand alone programs can use several forms of CommandPane<P>
          <li> With the visual Elements<P>
          <li> Without the visual Elements<P>
          <li> Just the one line translator :execOneLine<P>
          <li> With a data set or data sets passed in at Construction time<P>
          <li> With a data set passed in using the addDataSet method<P>
         </ol>

  </ul><P>

<li> With javac
  <ul> Most low-level routines have been extracted and repackaged so that they can be used by javac.<P>
        javac can do the looping, if-then- else , etc. <ul>
           This would be faster and more extensible</ul><P>
       The routines are currently in the execOneLine class.

  </ul>

</ol>
