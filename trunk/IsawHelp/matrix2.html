User inputs unit cell parameters.  Program then tries to index
some reflections and calculate an orientation matrix.<P><P>

<OL>This program requires the following <B>INPUTS</B>:<P>

<LI> A Peaks file.<Br>
     Enter via the Menu bar under <B>File Load Peaks File</B><P>

<LI> Unit Cell Parameters:<BR>
     Enter in text box to the right of <B>Lattice Parameters</b><P>

<LI> Centering:<Br>
     Enter in the text box to the right of <b>Centering</b><P>

<LI> Delta 1 :<Br>
     Enter to the right of <b>Delta 1</b>. This gives the tolerance
     in the length of the first and second peaks from possible 
     theoretical peaks.<P>

<LI> Delta 2 :<Br>
     Enter to the right of <b>Delta 2</b>. This is related to the tolerance
     in the angle between the two peaks compared with some theoretical peaks. .<P>

<LI> Two Peaks:<Br>
     Enter the Sequence number of the two peaks desired.  You can view the Peaks
     file under <I>View/Peaks File</I> from the Menubar<P>

<LI> Corresponding h,k,l values(optional):<BR>
     The format you enter these is (for example) <U>3,5,-8</U>. These values can be selected from
     lists in the <B><U>Peak 1 HKL's</U></B> tab or the <B><U>Peak 2</U></B> HKL's tab.<P>
</ol><P><P>
<UL><UL>

<LI>In Addition: Other sequence numbers can be added to see how close their hkl values are
to an integer.  This appears under the <B><U>UB mats</U></B> tab in the bottom part of
this window.<P>

<LI>Also, you can specify hkl values for the two selected peaks.<P><P>
</ul></ul><HR>



<H1><Center> Program Operation </Center></H1><P>

After the information is input at the top, the tabs at the bottom display results and also allow the user to select
a choice out of any of the lists.  The operations of these tabs are expanded below:<P><P>

<OL> Tab information and selection abilities<P>
<LI> <B><U>Peak 1 HKL's</U></B> tab:
     <UL>
         <LI> Lists all possible hkl values whose corresponding q value's length is within <B>Delta 1</B> of the
               first selected q value(  Under Point 1 's Seq Num at the top)<P>
          <LI> Selecting one line in the table will select that as the desired hkl value for the first Peak.
                if the top line is selected, all of these hkl values will be considered unless the user
                 specified a choice in the top part of the form<P>
     </UL><P>
<LI> <B><U>Peak 2 HKL's</U></B> tab:
     <UL> 
          <LI> Lists all possible hkl values whose corresponding q value's length is within <B>Delta 1</B> of the
               2nd selected q value(  Under Point 2 's Seq Num at the top) and whose "angle" with the first
               selected peak is within <B>Delta 2</B> of the angle between the theoretical hkl1 peak and hkl2 peak.<P>
          <LI> Selecting one line in the table will select that as the desired hkl values for both the 
               first Peak and the second peak.  If the top line is selected, all of these hkl values will be
                considered unless the user
                 specified a choice in the top part of the form<P>
     </UL><P>
<LI> <B><U>UB mats</U></B> tab:
     <UL>
       <LI> This lists all the possible UB matrices for the selected peaks.  If more than one hkl value is selected
        for at least one peak, a list of UB matrices will be presented.<P>
       <LI> Other information appears on this form to indicate the goodness of fit.  The fraction of peaks indexed
            at various levels and the indexing of the Other Seq Nums are given.<P>
       <LI> A specific UB matrix can be selected by pressing the Select button in this form. This will be the matrix
            that is saved( <B><U>Menubar</U>-<U>File</U>-<U>Save Orientation Matrix</U></B>)
     </UL><P>
</OL><P><P>
<HR>
<H1><CENTER> Output </CENTER></H1>
The only output of the program is the Selected UB matrix. It must be selected from the List in the 
    <B><U>UB mats</U></B> tab. Then saved using the option from <B><U>Menubar</U>-<U>File</U>-<U>Save Orientation Matrix</U></B>
