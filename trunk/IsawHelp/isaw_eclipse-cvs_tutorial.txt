To use Eclipse for ISAW development and CVS access.
-This document was prepared using Eclipse 3.1.1.

Run Eclipse and start with a clean workspace.
At each stage of this procedure you may have to wait for Eclipse to finish 
trying (and failing since we are not completely set up) to build everything.

- I recommend deselecting Project->Build Automatically at this point.
- Select File->New->Project.
- Select CVS->Checkout project from CVS.
- Click "Next".
- In the "Host to:" text field, input:  "gandalf.pns.anl.gov" 
  or "arwen.pns.anl.gov"
- (for onsite or offsite access)In "Repository Path to:", input: 
  "/usr/local/cvsroot"
- Fill in username and password 
- Connection type to: "extssh" or "ext". (This choice depends on if you are 
  using anything except for Eclipse to do CVS access. If you use only Eclipse 
  then select extssh if you need to use other CVS tools use ext and make sure 
  to define the environment variable CVS_RSH properly.)
- Specify module name "ISAW".
- Click "Next".
- Select "Check out as project configured using the New Project Wizard".
- Click "Next".
- Leave the Tag field blank and click "Finish".
- In the project wizard select "Java Project" & click "Next".
- For the Project Name type in "ISAW" and click "Next".
- Click "Finished".
- Now, copy the following Jar files into one directory (one directory for 
  convenience): sgt_v2.jar, jhall.jar, jnexus.jar, jogl.jar, jython.jar, 
  sdds.jar, servlet.jar.
- Right click on ISAW project & select "Build Path"->"Configure Build Path...".
- On "Libraries" tab, select "Add External JARs.." and add the jarfiles listed 
  above.
- On "Order and Export" tab select all of the Jar files for sharing with other 
  projects (i.e. check the box for each).
- Close this box by clicking OK.
- Select File->import.
- Select "Checkout projects from CVS".
- Select "Use existing repository location". Click "Next".
- Specify module "IPNS" and click "Next"
- Select "Check out into existing project" and click "Next"
- Choose IPNS as the target folder and ISAW as the parent folder.
- Click "Next"
- Leave Tag blank and Click "Next"
- Package will download into the specified project. Repeat this procedure for 
  gov, SSG_Tools & ISIS.
- Note that when asked about the repository you can now select the existing 
  repository.
- Make sure to recheck Projects->Build Automatically .
- At this point, things should build and all of the errors should be gone.
- If things do not rebuild select File->Refresh.
