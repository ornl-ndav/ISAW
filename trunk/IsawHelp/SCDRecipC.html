    <LI> <UL>Information
             <LI> Load Orientation Matrix-Loads orientation matrix into a*,b*, and c*
             <LI> Current Results- Shows several goodnes of fit measures of the current settings
                                     to the data
         </ul>
    <LI> Omit - Allows for omitting peaks that are uncentroided,  selected, or whose h,k, or l values within a certain
                tolerance of an integer.
    <LI> Tweak-Allows for making adjustments to a*-b*, a*c* and b*c* planes to get better results. Certain measures
              are displayed for goodness of fit.  
    <LI> Attributes- Allows the user to change the marks for peaks and the size of the marks.  The user must select
               OK to make the changes.

 <B>NOTE:</B> For blind to work correctly, peaks on adjacent planes are desirable.  It is possible to select peaks several planes apart, then use
    the # Steps part of the Selection control to divide the length of the vector from the origin by 2 or 3...  This could give more accuracy.
    
 <B>NOTE:</B> It would be beneficial to get a "unit cell" at this point. Below are some hints at doing this.
 <UL>
    <UL> Hints at getting a unit cell
      <li> Get planes by moving the azimuthal and altitude controls around until there is a sequence of parallel lines
      <li> Next delicately tweak this line by slowly adjusting the controls until most peaks are in line behind a front peak.   There should be very few
           peaks showing and they should all be separated.
      <li> Select the origin on the top of a pile of peaks with several peaks beneath.  Select a second peak at the bottom of this pile.  Then
            determine the number of steps between these two points( good luck). Put that in the # Steps text area for the second peaks and press return
      <li> You must do this two more times.  Keep in mind you can move the origin at any time to get to a good center.

        when these are least squared.<P><P>
