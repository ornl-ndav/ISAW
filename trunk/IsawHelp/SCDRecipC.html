 <H1> <Center> Reciprocal Lattice Viewer for Selecting <B><U>Points</U></B> (Peaks) </Center></H1>
 
 The 4 points used will be a*, b*, c*, and the origin.  These 4 points will be sent into blind directly.<P>
 
 <B>NOTE:</B> For blind to work correctly, peaks on adjacent planes are desirable.  It is possible to select peaks several planes apart, then use
    the # Steps part of the Selection control to divide the length of the vector from the origin by 2 or 3...  This could give more accuracy.
    
 <B>NOTE:</B> It would be beneficial to get a "unit cell" at this point. Below are some hints at doing this.
 <UL>
    <UL> Hints at getting a unit cell
      <li> Get planes by moving the azimuthal and altitude controls around until there is a sequence of parallel lines
      <li> Next delicately tweak this line by slowly adjusting the controls until most peaks are in line behind a front peak.   There should be very few
           peaks showing and they should all be separated.
      <li> Select the origin on the top of a pile of peaks with several peaks beneath.  Select a second peak at the bottom of this pile.  Then
            determine the number of steps between these two points( good luck). Put that in the # Steps text area for the second peaks and press return
      <li> You must do this two more times.  Keep in mind you can move the origin at any time to get to a good center.

                 squared.<P><P>
