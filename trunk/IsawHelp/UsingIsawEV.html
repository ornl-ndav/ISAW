<P>
IsawEV provides a 3D scatter plot of detected neutrons, mapped to reciprocal
space, conventional line graphs of intensity vs |Q| and intensity vs
d-spacing, and images of portions of reciprocal space near Bragg peaks.
The data may come from SNS raw event files, or from live data
on the instrument computer.  IsawEV also supports finding, indexing and 
integrating peaks in single crystal data.
</P>

<P>
IsawEV requires additional geometry information about the instrument to 
be able to map events to reciprocal space.  Currently, default geometry 
information is provided for TOPAZ, SNAP, PG3, ARCS, SEQUOIA and CNCS by
files in the InstrumentInfo/SNS/<instrument name> sub-directory of the
ISAW distribution directory.  The needed geometry files can also be specified 
on the Load Data form, if the default files are not provided for an 
instrument, or if it is necessary to load data from an event file made with
an updated (or previous) instrument geometry.
</P>

<P>
<FONT size=+1>Loading a File</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
To load data from a *neutron_event.dat FILE, press the "Load Data" button 
on the left side of the control panel. If the "Configure" tab is selected,
the run number and goniometer angles can be entered. The values entered
will be recorded in the peaks file so that peaks files from multiple runs
can be exported to other applications.  Currently, IsawEV can only be used
with one run at a time.
To actually load the data from a file, select the "From File" tab, then press
the "Neutron Event File" button to select the raw event data file to load.
If the events are to be weighted by the incident spectrum select the 
incident spectrum file by pressing the incident spectrum button.  
<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: The event file is the only file that needs to be specified, if the 
default geometry is OK.  If the instrument detector geometry has been change
of if you are loading an old event file from a previous version of the
instrument, then a .DetCal, Bank File and ID Map File that correspond to 
the correct instrument geometry must be specified. 
<BR>
<BR>
The min/max |Q| values to load can be specified before loading the data.
In addition, parameters to apply the corrections from ANVRED to individual
events can be specified.  The power on lamda should be 4, for the Lorentz
correction of Bragg peaks.  However, different values of that power can be
used to balance the apparent intensities at large and small |Q|.  This can
help with finding peaks.  When the required file(s) and desired parameters  
have been specified, press the "Load" button at the bottom of the
form to actually load the file.  Events should start to show up in the
3D viewer, within a few seconds of starting to load the data.  The number
of events to show in 3D must be limited to avoid overloading the graphics
hardware.
</P>


<P>
<FONT size=+1>Viewing Live Data</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
To view live data on the instrument computer, select the "From Live Data"
tab, instead of the "From File" tab.   You must also select the
instrument name from the drop down menu.  To start listening for live events, 
press the Load button at the bottom of the panel.  In order to adjust the 
3D view temporarily stop 
listening for events by pressing the "Pause" button.  To resume
listening for live events, press the "Continue" button.  To clear out all 
loaded events and stop listening for new events, press the
"Pause & Clear" button.  Press "Continue" to start listening for and
accumulating new events.
<BR>
<BR>
Reasonable default values are provided for the Calibration File, Bank File
and Mapping file for supported instruments.  If any of these options, 
min/max |Q| or absorption parameters are changed, the "Load" button at the 
bottom of the form must be pressed again to re-initialize the internal data
structures with the new values.  The Continue button will not make any such
changes.
<BR>
<BR>
Live events can be obtained from the
"Live Data Server" that should be running on all SNS instrument computers.
IF the Live Data Server is not running, and IsawEV is running on a 
computer that is directly connected to the DAS network, then ISAW can get
events directly from the DAS.  NOTE: If the Live Data Server is running
on the instrument computer, and IsawEV is running on the instrument computer
then IsawEV will NOT be able to get events directly, but MUST get events 
that are passed to it by the Live Data Server.
<BR>
<BR>
By default, IsawEV will automatically try to get events from the Live Data 
Server, running on the instrument computer for the specified instrument.
Selecting the "Only Connect to Port" option will instead try to get live
events on the specified port.  In that case either the Live Data Server
must be manually set to send events to that specified port, OR if the 
Live Data Server is not running then the port must be set to 8002 to get
events directly from the DAS on the DAS network.
<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: For convenience, the rate at which live events are being received is
displayed on the "From Live Data" tab.  The value is updated every few 
seconds and shows the average number of "Counts Per Second" during the 
previous second.  The time of the measurement is also displayed.  If events
are no longer being received, the time of the last count rate measurement
is shown.
</P>


<P>
<FONT size=+1>Maximum/Minimum Q range</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
For either file or live data, the maximum and minimum |Q| values to be 
loaded can be specified.  The specified minimum !Q! must be at least zero and
less than the specified maximum !Q!.  Restricting the !Q! range of events
can help omit noisy data values at small or large |Q|.
This is particularly helpful when trying to find peaks in single crystal 
data.  Eliminating the large |Q| values often allows setting a lower 
threshold for peaks to find more valid peaks, without finding a lot of
spurious peaks in the noisy high |Q| range.  Adjusting Max |Q| also reallocates
the underlying histogram to cover the specified range.  If Max |Q| is decreased
the histogram bins will decrease in size correspondingly, providing a higher
resolution histogram, with lower counts in each bin.
</P>


<P>
<FONT size=+1>Filtering Events</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
For either file or live data, events can also be filtered based on 
detector, row and column number, and based on their d or |Q| values.
These filters are controlled by the "Filter Events" panel.  The filtering
must be set up BEFORE loading the file or live events. The
"Filter Events" panel has two tabbed panes.  
<BR>
<BR>
On the "Detector" tabbed pane, you can specify whole detectors, or rows and
columns of detectors that should be masked off.  Events from any specified
detectors, rows and columns will be omitted as the events are loaded.  For
example, if the user enters 3:5,9 in the "Detectors" column of line one of 
the table, and leaves the "Row(s)" and "Col(s)" columns blank, then data
from detectors 3,4,5, and 9 will be excluded as the events are loaded.
Similarly, if the user enters 1:5,252:256 in the "Row(s)" and "Col(s)"
columns, of line 2 of the table, but leaves the "Detector(s)" column blank,
then these rows and columns will also be deleted for all detectors.  Finally,
if the user entered  17,18 in the "Detector(s)" column of line 3 and
"1:20" in the "Row(s)" column and "150:17" in the "Col(s)" column then events
from the specified rows and columns of detectors 17 and 18 will also
be excluded when the events are loaded.  
<BR>
<BR>
Up to 15 such conditions can be specified on the lines of the detector mask
table. This provides a fairly flexible way to specify detectors or portions of
detectors to be masked off.  If greater flexibility is required, a file
specifying individual pixel IDs to mask off could be loaded.  This feature
will be implemented in a later version of IsawEV.
<BR>
<BR>
On the "d, !Q!" tabbed pane, you can mask off (or include) events based 
on intervals around specified d or |Q| values by.  For example, the user 
could specify a comma
separated list of d-values for several strong aluminum peaks in the
"List Values" text box, and specify an appropriate peak width in the 
"Delta_Value/Value" box, in order to omit the aluminum peaks from the 
data.  The intervals can be specified in terms of "d", or |Q| depending 
on the choice of "Value units".  Alternatively, if only certain ranges 
of d or |Q| are of interest, the user can specify these values and select
"Keep Values" instead of "Omit Values".
<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: To activate these filters, the "Set" button on the bottom of the 
forms must be pressed.  The filters will then take effect for events that are 
loaded AFTER the filters were set.  The filters will remain in effect 
until the "Clear" buttons are pressed.
</P>


<P>
<FONT size=+1>Absorption Correction</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
The data displayed in the 3D event view consists of "fractional" events,
obtained by applying corrections to the data similar to those carried out
by the ANVRED program.  In particular, a spherical absorption correction
can be applied to the data by specifying a sample radius that is greater
than zero.  No absorption correction will be done if the radius is zero or
negative.  In addition to the sample radius, values for the scattering mu
and for the absorption mu coefficients can be specified.  As a first,
rough approximation, these can be taken to be 1. 
</P>


<P>
<FONT size=+1>Using the 3D View</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
The 3D window shows a scatter plot of the weighted events mapped to reciprocal
space.  When the 3D view is NOT being updated with new live data, you can 
interact with this view in several ways.
<BR>
<BR>
1. Press the left mouse button and drag the mouse to rotate the view
the current view reference point.
<BR>
<BR>
2. Press the middle mouse button and drag up/down on the screen to move
in and out of the scene.  In this mode, the center of the view volume,
marked by the small coordinate axes, moves along with the observer.
<BR>
<BR>
3. If you have a mouse with a middle "wheel" then rolling the wheel
will move the observer closer to or farther from the center of the view, 
marked by the small coordinate axes.
<BR>
<BR>
4. Press the right mouse button and drag to pan across the 3D scene.
<BR>
<BR>
5. The initial view is a perspective view.  This can be switched to an
Orthographic view by selecting that option on the "Draw Options" panel
and pressing "Apply".  The Orthographic view is most useful for verifying
that diffraction peaks from a single crystal "line up" and form a lattice.
<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: Since Operations 1. and 2. also move the center of the view 
in and out of the screen, the center of rotations changes.  All rotations
are about the center of view, marked by the small coordinate axes.
<BR>
<BR>
You can also click on an event in the 3D view and see information 
about that event, such as the detector pixel, Q, time-of-flight, etc.
This information is displayed in a panel that is made visible by
pressing the "Selected Point" panel on the left side of the 
display.  It may be easier to select points if the point size is 
increased from 1 to 3  using the Point Size control on the Drawing Options
form.
</P>

<P>
<FONT size=+1>Color Scale (IMPORTANT)</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
The color of the events displayed is based on the histogram value for
that position in reciprocal space, and a color scale controlled from 
a panel activated by pressing the "Color Scale" button.  The most
IMPORTANT role of the color scale is to provide a threshold below
which events will NOT be marked in 3D.  If all events are shown, the
3D space fills with events and it is difficult to see any patterns
present in the data.  The "Data Min" on the Color Edit Panel should
be set high enough so that excessive background noise s not shown, 
and low enough to see patterns in the data such as diffraction rings
or isolated peaks.  
</P>

<P>
<FONT size=+1>Q and D graphs</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
Graphs of intensity vs |Q| and intensity vs d-spacing can be
displayed from the "Additional Views" panel.  The graphs can be
"popped up" or "popped down" using the "Show Q Graph" and 
"Show D Graph" check boxes.  The graphs are dynamically updated
when loading live data.  The graphs can use uniform bin sizes,
or bin sizes that keep delta_x/x constant, i.e. a "Log" scale.
The choice of using uniform or log binning must be made before 
events are loaded.  If this option is changed, the data file must be
reloaded, or the live event stream must be paused, cleared and restarted
to use the new binning scheme.
</P>
<P>
<FONT size=+1>Drawing Options</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
Some drawing options may be useful and are controlled from the
"Draw Options" panel.  The most useful options are changing to
an Orthographic View (instead of than the default perspective view)
and changing the point size.  For example, if the scatter plot 
is very full of points it may help to set the Point Size down to 1.
After altering some draw options, press the Apply button at the
bottom of the panel to make them effective.
</P>

<P>
<FONT size=+1>Finding Peaks</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
IsawEV maintains an underlying histogram of events in 
reciprocal space.  Previous versions used a 512x512x512 histogram
requiring 500 Megabytes.  This version uses a 768x768x768 histogram
which requires 1.8 Gigabytes.  This will be configurable by the user
in future versions.  The Find Peaks panel can be used to search through 
this histogram for local maxima.  The maximum number of peaks
to find and the minimum peak intensity can be specified to control the
find peaks process.  The peaks that are found will be marked on the
3D scatter plot.  By examining the 3D scatter plot it is possible to
see whether or not the peaks that were found form a lattice pattern.
Lowering the threshold, or increasing
the Max number of peaks will increase the number of points identified
as peaks.  Since the histogram contains fractional counts 
from weighted events, the minimum intensity can be any float value 
greater than zero.  If zero is specified a threshold will be selected
automatically.  If too many "noise" peaks are present (often at high |Q|)
the threshold should be raised and/or the number of peaks should be 
lowered.  This is useful for finding an appropriate set peaks for 
indexing SCD data.  
<BR>
<BR>
Images of peaks that are found will be displayed if the "Show Peak Images"
option is checked.  This will display horizontal slices through the peak 
extracted from the underlying reciprocal space histogram.  The extent of 
the horizontal slices that are imaged around the peak can be specified as
well as the number of slices to include above or below the peak.
NOTE: These images are interactive in the following ways.  You can zoom in on 
portions of the peaks, step through slices above and below the peaks and
information about points on the image is displayed on the "Selected Point"
form.  A large red asterisk marks the currently Selected Point on the 
3D view of reciprocal space.
<BR>
<BR>
Peaks that are found will be marked by white boxes.  The "Mark Size" 
parameter controls the size of the boxes that will be drawn.  The Mark Size
must be specified BEFORE finding peaks.

</P>

<P>
<FONT size=+1>Indexing Peaks</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
Once peaks have been found, they can be indexed.  In particular,
two basic methods to get an initial orientation matrix and indexing 
are currently supported in IsawEV.  
One method requires good estimates of all six lattice parameters. 
This method is quite robust.  The other method attempts to index the 
peaks automatically.  The automatic method often produces better results
if reasonable estimates of the min and max for primitive cell edge lengths
are specified.  For example if the crystal should be cubic with a=b=c=5,
entering a min of 4 and a max of 6 should work well.  The auto-indexing
method produces a (possibly long) list of orientation matrices to choose from.
If an orientation matrix is available in a file, the peaks can also be
indexed using that matrix.  For any of the indexing methods the 
quality of the indexing can be assessed by looking at the Peaks Info panel.
This panel shows how many peaks were indexed, and provides histograms
showing deviations of the indexed peaks from integer h, k and l values.
The list of peaks can also be displayed from this panel.  This information
can be written to a file using the "Write Peaks File" button on the 
"Find Peaks" panel.
</P>

<P>
<FONT size=+1>Choosing a Conventional Cell Type</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
Once a reduced cell has been determined, the "Cell Type" form can be used
to determine the conventional cell.  This is done by matching the current
reduced cell with entries from
Table 2 from the paper:  "Lattice Symmetry and Identification -- The 
Fundamental Role of Reduced Cells in Materials Characterization", Alan D. 
Mighell, Vol. 106, Number 6, Nov-Dec 2001, Journal of Research of the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology.  The error tolerance for matches
that will be listed can be specified using the "Max Error" field at the top 
of the form.  The types of cells and centering to be included can also 
be specified.  After changing the error tolerance or cell type restrictions,
press the "Update List" button to adjust the list of possible matches 
using the new error and/or cell type restrictions.  A possible choice can
be selected by entering the choice number on the form, or by stepping through
the list until the desired choice is visible.  Pressing the 
"Apply Displayed Cell" will transform the current orientation matrix to
correspond to the chosen conventional cell, and will index the peaks
using the new orientation matrix.  The "Apply Displayed Cell" button should 
only be pushed one time after finding peaks.  The current orientation matrix
will be altered to one corresponding to the selected conventional cell.  In
most cases this new cell will NOT be a reduced cell.  Consequently, the 
options displayed will NOT be meaningful, after pressing the "Apply Displayed Cell" button.  Valid options will be presented if the peaks are first re-indexed.
</P>

<P>
<FONT size=+1>Integrating Peaks</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
Two methods are provided for integrating peaks.  Currently, both methods 
are just quick approximate methods, intended to give some indication of 
integrated intensities and the number of peaks that have been measured.
These quick integrate methods are on the "Integrate" form.
<BR>
<BR>
The "Sphere Method" integrates peaks using values in the underlying histogram.
For each peak, all histogram bins whose centers are within the specified sphere
radius are assumed to belong to the peak.  Similarly a somewhat larger 
spherical shell is used to estimate the background.  The net integrated 
intensity is then calculated by subtracting the appropriately scaled background
from the total of the bins in the peak.  This sphere integration method 
will be applied only to the peaks in the current peak list if the
"Current Peaks" option is selected.  If the "Current Peaks" are those peaks
that were found using the Find Peaks form, then all of those peaks should 
be fairly strong, accurately centroided and integrate quite well.  This option
will only work if peaks have already been found.  The "All Predicted Positions"
option will only work if peaks have been found AND indexed.  In that case the
orientation matrix will be used to predict peak positions, and those
predicted positions will be used as the centers of integration spheres.  
After selecting the appropriate option, pressing the "Show Statistics" button
will do the integrations and display how many peaks were integrated above 
various I/sigI thresholds.  However, the peak list will NOT be affected.  If
instead, the "Update Peaks List" button is pressed, then the integrated 
intensities will be written to the list of peaks.  Choosing the menu option
View->Show_Peaks will pop up the list of integrated peaks.
<BR>
<BR>
The "Aligned Histogram" method is highly experimental and requires reloading
all of the data after entering appropriate parameters.  This method forms
a new histogram which has it's bin centers aligned with the reciprocal lattice.
This can only be done after indexing peaks.  The user can specify then number
of steps per unit Miller index as a value between 2 and 25.  The amount of
memory required by the histogram will be displayed and it is important to 
verify that this is not too large for the memory installed on the system.
If say 10 steps per miller index are chosen, then the length of the shortest
edge of a reciprocal space cell will be divided by 10.  Call this length
a*/10.  The 3D histogram will be set up with bins of length a*/10 in the 
direction of that edge, shifted so that lattice points are in bin centers.
The other two edge lengths will be divided into an integer number of steps with 
the integer chosen so that the step size in |Q| will be as close to a*/10 as
possible.  The counts in bins containing the lattice points give the gross
peak intensity and the counts in neighboring bins are used to determine the
background level.  After selecting the Histogram Resolution, the 
Histogram Status will indicate that the histogram has been allocated and is
ready to add events.  At that point the event file must be reloaded so that
the histogram can be populated.  After the events have been reloaded, the
integrated intensities can either be use form a new peaks list, or the 
statistics about the integrated intensities can just be displayed. 
<BR>
<BR>
Currently, after forming this lattice-aligned histogram and reloading the 
events, a view of slices through the histogram will be displayed.
It will be necessary to step through these slices to move into the region
of reciprocal space that was measured.  Choosing 5 steps per Miller index
will give a fairly coarse histogram and images, but choosing 25 steps per
Miller index will give a nice high resolution set of images.


<P>
<FONT size=+1>Example Files</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
It may be helpful to work with a couple of "nice" example data files
to get comfortable using IsawEV.  
<BR>
<BR>
The file SNAP_240_neutron_event.dat has data from a quartz crystal on SNAP.
The lattice parameters should be approximately a=b=4.913, c=5.40,
alpha=beta=90, gamma=120.

<BR>
<BR>
The file ARCS_419_neutron_event.dat has data from a silicon crystal on ARCS.
The lattice parameters should be approximately a=b=c=5.431, alpha=beta=gamma=90.
