   <H1> <Center> Reciprocal Lattice Viewer for Selecting Planes of Peaks </Center></H1>
<ul>
<li>This viewer creates a display from Peaks and allows you to select 3 planes. The 
    information on these planes are returned when the viewer is exitted.<P>
     <ol type="1"> <a name="Planes"></a>The 3 planes are defined as follows:
       <li> Plane 1 information is calculated when the a*<->b* Slice button is pressed.
            This plane is determined by the points selected for the origin, a*, and b*.<P>
       <li>Plane 2 information is calculated when the b*<->c* Slice button is pressed.
            This plane is determined by the points selected for the origin, b*, and c*.<P>
       <li>Plane 3 information is calculated when the c*<->a* Slice button is pressed.
            This plane is determined by the points selected for the origin, a*, and c*.<P>
     </ol>
     
     <P>
     <UL> Using the controls on the viewer
       <li>Distance control: Moves the display closer/farther from the center. This seems
           to have to be moved at first to get any display<P>
       <li> Azimuthal control: Rotates the display around the vertical( Fixed and blue)
            axis<P>
       <li> Altitude control: Rotates the display around the line from the center
          pointing to the right.<P>
       <li><B><U>NOTE:</U></B> The azimuthal and altitude controls are used to align the peaks on
          lines in the display. These lines of peaks usually define a plane, since usually
          these points are not all on one line.

     <UL> Mouse Actions
       <li> Clicking on a Peak in the display will set Qxyz information box.<P>
       <li> Clicking on the origin will replace the origin by the contents in the Qxyz
           information box.<P>
       <li> Clicking on the a*(+),b*(*), or c*(X) buttons will transfer the contents
          of the Qxyz point with the origin subtracted to the corresponding positions.
          NOTE: a*,b* and c* are directions. The program automatically converts to and
          from directions to points where necessary.<P>
       <li> Clicking on the a*<->b* Slice,b*<->c* Slice,and the c*<->a* Slice will define
            planes as indicated <a href="#Planes">above</a>. The points of the plane will
             be marked so it is possible to determine the planes that have already been 
             selected. If the mark is a "+" this is the a*b* plane. If the mark is a "*", it
             is the b*c* plane and if the mark is a "X" it is the c*a* plane.<P>
       <LI><a name="editPlanes"></a> NOTE: Clicking the mouse at a point with no peak causes the Qxyz information
           box to be undefined. Then clicking on the a*(+), b*(*), or c*(X) buttons will
           cause those to become undefined( and the marks disappear). The Planes become
           undefined( and marks disappear) if the corresponding origin,a*,b*, or c* values
           are undefined when a Slice button are pressed.<P>
        <LI> A new plane is not parallel to the others if at least two of the three plane
            marks are not on the same line.  3 distinct planes should be selected.<P>
       
     </UL>
     
     <OL type = "1"> HINTS on Getting 3 distinct planes
        <li> Use the azimuthal and altitude controls to get the peaks aligned into
            parallel lines.<P>
        <li> Select one line and pick a point at the center. Then click the origin/Select
             button.<P>
        <li> Select another point on the line a ways away from the first point. Then
             press the a*(+) Select button.<P>
        <li> Now rotate the display a bit to find points behind the front points( use the
           azimuthal and altitude controls). Pick a point and press the b*(*) Select button.
           Check and make sure the three points are not collinear or close to collinear. Use
           the azimuthal and altitude controls to look at the three points at different angles.<P>
        <LI> Press the b*(*) Select button then press the a*<->b* Slice button.<P>
        
        <li> Clear out the origin, a*,and b* values and their displays by clicking at a
          point in the display so the Qxyz information box says undefined. Then click the
          origin, a*, and b* Select button.<P>
        <LI> Repeat steps 1 through 6 with another alignment of peaks.  Make sure that
           the marks from the a*<->b* Slice button are NOT all on the same  line in this
           display. Put the points in the origin,b*(*), and c*(X) positions and press the
           b*<->c* Slice button.<P>
         <LI> Repeat steps 1 through 6 with another alignment of peaks. Here make sure 
           the marks for each selected plane do NOT lie on the same line. Here, put the
           points in the origin, a*(+),and  c*(X) positions and select the c*<->a* button
           <P>
        <LI> Now you can exit the display. You can also <a href ="#editPlanes">edit the planes</a>.
