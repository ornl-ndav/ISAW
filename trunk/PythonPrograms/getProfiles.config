# Specify the run numbers that should be reduced.  This can be done on several
# lines.  Each line must start with the parameter name run_nums and be followed
# by a comma separated list of individual run numbers or ranges of run numbers.
# A range of run numbers is specified by listing the first number and last
# number in the range, separated by a colon.
#
run_nums  6347:6348 

#
# Specify the slurm partion, or None to use local processes.  The parameter
# max_processes controls the maximum number of processes that will be run 
# simultaneously locally, or that will be simultaneously submitted to slurm.
# The value of max_processes should be choosen carefully with the size of the
# system in mind, to avoid overloading the system.  Since the lower level 
# calculations are all multi-threaded, this should be substantially lower than
# the total number of cores available.
# All runs will be processed eventually.  If there are more runs than then
# max_processes, as some processes finish, new ones will be started, until
# all runs have been processed.
