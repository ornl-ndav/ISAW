# Configuration file for profile_fit_1run.py.

#
# To run the script, type:
#
#     python profile_fit_1run.py profile_fit.config NRUN
#
# where profile_fit5.config is this config file and NRUN
# is the run number.
#
# If running on txc01.ccr.buffalo.edu and if you will
# be using curve_fit, then you may need to type:
#
#     python2.7 profile_fit_1run.py profile_fit.config NRUN
#

# Each line can either start with a comment, indicated by a '#' mark or start
# with a parameter name and value, optionally followed by a comment.  ALL 
# parameters used by the script must be specified.  If a required parameter 
# is not specified, the script will terminate with a message indicating which 
# parameter was missing.

# Specify the run numbers that should be reduced.  This can be done on several
# lines.  Each line must start with the parameter name run_nums and be followed
# by a comma separated list of individual run numbers or ranges of run numbers.
# A range of run numbers is specified by listing the first number and last
# number in the range, separated by a colon.

# Specify the slurm partion, or None to use local processes.  The parameter
# max_processes controls the maximum number of processes that will be run 
# simultaneously locally, or that will be simultaneously submitted to slurm.
# The value of max_processes should be choosen carefully with the size of the
# system in mind, to avoid overloading the system.  Since the lower level 
# calculations are all multi-threaded, this should be substantially lower than
# the total number of cores available.
# All runs will be processed eventually.  If there are more runs than then
# max_processes, as some processes finish, new ones will be started, until
# all runs have been processed.
