Instructions to build ISAW with Peter Peterson's installer.  
( Revised 3/27/2008, D.M. )

This file describes how to build the ISAW distribution on a 
Linux system, assuming you have SVN access to the repository at

ORNL:  https://flathead.ornl.gov/repos

The repository is "hard coded" into the script svn_ISAW in the
build_scripts directory.

Currently, only building from the current revision in the SVN
repository is supported.  However, you should record the SVN
revision numbers as comments in the svn_ISAW.config file, so that
if need be old versions could be rebuilt, with some manual
interventions.  (That is, use separate command line svn export
statements to get the older versions of the source code.)

1. You must have the directory IsawMake in your HOME directory.
   Also:
     -- the IsawMake directory must contain the directory
        with the build scripts (build_scripts).
     -- the IsawMake directory must contain the directory,
        packup, that holds the various shared libraries 
        needed by the ISAW system, and other files that will
        be placed in the distribution .jar file.
     -- add the .../IsawMake/build_scripts directory to your path.
     -- Python must be installed on your system for some of the
        build scripts.
     -- check that the directories listed in the scripts:
           .../IsawMake/build_scripts/dennis_make_distro.sh
           .../IsawMake/build_scripts/build-installer
        scripts are correct for your system.

2. Before doing a build, copy the latest versions of the scripts from
   ISAW/BuildInfo/scripts to IsawMake/build_scripts

3. In the IsawMake home directory, place the file: 

       svn_ISAW.config

   which contains the version number and date information used by the
   svn_ISAW script.  Edit this file so that the top configuration line
   contains the proper version number, build date and time.  You should
   also add a comment line containing the svn version numbers for each
   of the packages..

4. Checkout the complete source tree from the repository by giving 
   the command:

      'svn_ISAW'

   NOTE: In addition to exporting the source code from SVN, the
         svn_ISAW modifies some of the other build scripts to
         set the proper version number and date!!!

   NOTE: For some reason this sometimes "hangs" during the export
         operation.  In that case, svn_ISAW will have modified the
         build scripts, and it should work to manually export the
         files using:

         svn export https://flathead.ornl.gov/repos/ISAW/trunk ISAW
         svn export https://flathead.ornl.gov/repos/IPNS/trunk IPNS
         svn export https://flathead.ornl.gov/repos/ipns-gov/trunk  gov
         svn export https://flathead.ornl.gov/repos/ipns-ISIS/trunk ISIS
         svn export https://flathead.ornl.gov/repos/SSG_Tools/trunk SSG_Tools

         'svn_ISAW' does not "hang" when executed on the local SNS systems, 
         such as outback.sns.gov.  

5. Build the class files, docs etc. by giving the command:

      'dennis_make_distro.sh'

   This will create four jar files named using the current PACKDATE
   (doc_PACKDATE.jar, IPNS_PACKDATE.jar, Isaw_PACKDATE.jar, and 
    Operators_PACKDATE.jar) which can be used to create the installer.

6. Build the installer and pack up the distribution jar by giving the command:

      'build-installer'

    This should make the file Isaw-nnnn-install.jar, where nnnn is the
    version number specified in the first line of the 
    svn_ISAW.config file.

7. Put the Isaw-nnnn-install.jar file on the ISAW ftp site at ORNL:

    http://ftp.sns.gov/ISAW 

   It can be browsed via HTTP and FTP.  To place the .jar file there,
   use sftp to faregate.ornl.gov and put the file in /var/ftp/ISAW. 

8. Send an annoucement to the isaw mailing list:  isaw@email.ornl.gov.
   The web site for the mailing list is:
       https://email.ornl.gov/mailman/listinfo/isaw
