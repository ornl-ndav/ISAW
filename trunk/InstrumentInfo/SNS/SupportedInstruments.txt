# Version 1.0
#
# List of instrument names and computers from which a live event stream
# may be obtained from Jim Kohl's event catcher.  The instrument names 
# are used in several parts of ISAW.  The computer names are currently
# (3/22/2010) just used in IsawEV.
#
# This file may start with an arbitrary number of comment lines
# that start with a '#' character.  The data in the file must have
# precisely two contiguous sequences of characters specifying the 
# instrument name and the computer name, separated by spaces.
#
# The version number is not currently used, but is included for possible
# future uses.
