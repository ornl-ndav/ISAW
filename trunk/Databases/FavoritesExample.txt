#               Favorites File Format/Example
#
# Each line of the file starts with
#          #--Comment
#          MENU= -- The name of menu if present( Favorites if not)
#          OPERATOR= -- The "filename" of the operator
#          PATH=     -- A comma delimited list of path/sub path/sub path names
#                       where the previous operator will be placed
#          TITLE=   --If present, the Title to represent the operator on the menu
#                      If not present, the operator Title will be used. NOTE: TITLE
#                      should be right after OPERATOR( before PATH )
#
#
# NOTES:
#    - This menu will be place on the main menu bar of Isaw's workbench(IsawGUI.Isaw) if
#      the favorites file is placed after "Favorites=" in IsawProps.dat. 
#
#    -The Operator "filename" can be found in the top line of the operator documentation
#     For operators written in java, it is the class name( without the .class if desired)
#         It does not include the path from root
#     The whole file name can be used for Operators written in python or Isaw scripts.
#         
#     These operators do NOT need to be "installed"(i.e. accessible to the Isaw scripting
#         language or Macros menu list). An Operator defined on a given line will be 
#         ignored unless a PATH= line comes before the next OPERATOR= line or end of file.
#
#     The operators that are placed under the same menu path are added in the order they
#         appear in the file
#
#     The TITLE is for the previous OPERATOR
#
