<strong><div align="center">Java Tutorial for Fortran Programmers</div></strong><br>
<hr><br>
By Chris M. Bouzek<br><hr><br>
This document is a mixture of a tutorial and a quick reference for Fortran programmers
who would like to make the move to Java programming.  It does not aim to be a
comprehensive guide for developing in Java.  Rather, it serves as a gentle entry into
the world of cross-platform, object oriented programming in Java.<br><hr><br>
<strong><div align="center">Essential differences between Fortran and Java</div></strong>
<br><hr><br>
<ul>
  <li> In Java, comments start with a "//" rather than a "C". </li>
  <li> Column position has no relevance in Java, i.e. a statement or comment
  may begin and end in any column, although the 80 column limit is still observed
  by convention. </li>
  <li> Variable names in Java may be 255 characters long, and have roughly the
  same naming conventions as Fortran (e.g. they may not start with a number). </li>
  <li> There are no implicit variables in Java, i.e. if you do not give a variable
  a type when you declare it, the compiler will complain. </li>
  <li> Although character arrays can be used for text strings, Java has a much more
  useful String class that we will explore later. </li>
  <li> goto statements are not allowed in Java. </li>
  <li> Nearly every Java statement requires a semicolon at the end. </li>

Fortran and Java share many similar data types, although the Fortran <strong>complex</strong>
variable is not supported in Java.  Below is a table listing showing some of the parallels
between Java and Fortran.<br><br><div align="center">

<strong><div align="center">Declaring Variables</div></strong><br><hr><br>
In general, declaring variables in Java is the same as declaring variables in Fortran.
Here are some examples of declaring integer values:<br><br>
<pre>
int myint1;          //declare an integer named myint1
int myint2 = 255;    //declare an integer named myint2 and initialize it to 255
</pre><br><br>
Note the use of the semicolon at the end of the statement, as it is almost always required after
a Java statement.  We can also declare a floating point variables:<br><br>
<pre>
float myfloat1;         //declare a floating point named myfloat1
float myfloat2 = 2.0f;  //declare a floating point named myfloat2 and initialize it to 2.0
</pre><br><br>
Note here that we used 2.0f rather than 2.0.  This is due to a quirk in Java: it does not allow
what is called a "narrowing conversion" from double precision to single precision floating
point values.  To illustrate:<br><br>
<pre>
float badfloat = 2.0;    //this will not work
double mydouble = 2.0;   //but this will
</pre><br><br>
