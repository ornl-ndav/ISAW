 *  Revision 1.1  2006/07/10 19:25:16  dennis
 *  Moved to DataSetTools.parameter, since this requires
 *  knowlege of DataSets.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2006/06/26 22:36:23  dennis
 *  setValue() and constructor now accept a null value and
 *  translate that into the DataSet.EMPTY_DATA_SET.
 *  Made a few minor fixes to javadocs.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2006/06/26 21:01:50  dennis
 *  Abstract base class for PGs whose value is a reference to
 *  a DataSet.  Eventually this should be moved out of the "gov"
 *  hierarchy, into the DataSetTools hierarchy.  Initially, we
 *  will keep this in the "gov" hierarchy, until the code base is
 *  switched to use the new parameter GUIs.
