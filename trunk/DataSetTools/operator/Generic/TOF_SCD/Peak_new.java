/**
 *  This class is a second pass at representing the key data for peaks,
 *  inspired by the original Peaks object put together by Peter Peterson.
 *  The goals were to make it simpler to use (fewer things mutable, more
 *  maintainable), and to use the detector grid concept, so that detectors
 *  and calibrations could better deal with area detectors in arbitrary
 *  positions and orientations.  Since this had to be implemented without
 *  breaking existing functionality, some further refinements to this
 *  concept are on hold, pending a complete separation of the new peak
 *  class from the original Peak class.  Currently there is an interface,
 *  IPeak that extracts some of the common functionality, but also partly
 *  binds the two implementations together.  Some of the work remaining to
 *  be done includes:
 * -- The calculation of nearedge MUST be be changed to allow for
 *    having bounds other than 1 & size.  Should the parameter-less
 *    nearedge be replaced by nearedge(minx,maxx,miny,maxy) in both
 *    the interface and in Peak_new?
 * -- methods detA, detA2, detD are not in interface but were needed
 *    for some places where Peak_new was used.  These should be removed
 *    as Peak and Peak_new are separated.
 * -- methods xcm, ycm are not needed for new format.  They should be
 *    removed from interface and Peak_new, as Peak and Peak_new are
 *    separated.
 * -- NeXus_coordinates method may belong in the interface, or perhaps
 *    in some utility class, if it doesn't get put in the interface.
 * -- Methods x,y,z should be renamed col, row, channel.
 * -- How should the instrument and facility name be handled?  Currently
 *    there are just getter's and setters for this in Peak_new but the
 *    getters are NOT in the interface.  These could be useful to have in
 *    the Peak_new class, IF we will need to deal with peaks from multiple
 *    instruments and multiple facilities.  In the mean time this just
 *    temporarily holds the values so that the information can be put
 *    at the top of the peaks file.
 * -- Methods to get and set the sequence number could be removed from
 *    the interface and from Peak_new, since the sequence numbers are
 *    just set by the order the peaks are written.
 * -- Methods to get the sample orientation and the grid were needed
 *    in practice, so they should probably be added to the interface.
 * -- The UB matrix could probably be removed IPeak and Peak_new, and
 *    have any methods that rely on this, just take a UB matrix as
 *    an additional parameter, rather than storing it in the peak object.
 * -- Currently, the t_zero shift is just stored (and returned by) the
 *    peak, but is not used by the peak.  Should this be removed?  It is
 *    handy when printing the peaks file, so that t_zero can be listed
 *    at the top, but that is all it is used for.
 * -- The new peaks file format should probably have l1 removed from the
 *    block of information at the start of a group of peaks, since
 *    that information is also recorded along with t_zero at the start
 *    of the file.
 * -- The d() method currently returns 1/|q| instead of 2pi/|q|, since
 *    that is what some old code expects.  This should be changed to
 *    return 2pi/|q| and code using this should be adjusted accordingly.
 * -- Currently, only the getUnrotQ() method returns double precision
 *    values.  That should probably be changed to return single, but
 *    the interface and old Peak object would also need to be changed.
 *    If the Peak_new and Peak can be separated, then either the
 *    getUnrotQ() could be changed to return floats, or the Peak_new
 *    class could be switched entirely to double.
