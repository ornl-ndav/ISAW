 *  $Log$
 *  Revision 1.6  2003/10/21 00:47:50  millermi
 *  - Now extends IViewComponent, thus requiring less
 *    methods to be outlined by this interface.
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2003/10/16 16:01:26  millermi
 *  - Added method getPointedAt() to get the current point.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2003/08/11 23:44:24  millermi
 *  - Changed getSelectedSet() to getSelectedRegions() which now
 *    returns an array of Regions.
 *  - Changed setSelectedSet() to setSelectedRegions() which now
 *    takes parameter of type Region.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2003/05/22 13:04:56  dennis
 *  Added method to get the display panel.  Changed to pass ViewMenuItems
 *  rather than JMenuItems to be placed in Menu bar. (Mike Miller)
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2003/05/16 14:59:53  dennis
 *  Added acknowlegement of NSF funding.
