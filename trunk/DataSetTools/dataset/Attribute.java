 * Modified:
 *
 *  $Log$
 *  Revision 1.47  2007/07/04 19:04:54  rmikk
 *  Changed the documentation for Attributes, ORIENT_MATRIX and SCD_CALIB
 *
 *  Revision 1.46  2005/06/17 13:17:59  dennis
 *  Removed method setName(), which is not used, and should not be
 *  present, since Attributes should be immutable.
 *
 *  Revision 1.45  2005/03/28 22:47:37  dennis
 *  Removed TITLE attribute, since the DataSet already has a
 *  field for the title.
 *
 *  Revision 1.44  2005/01/31 23:48:27  dennis
 *  Added attributes ENERGY and ENERGY_TRANSFER, for use with ToQE operator.
 *
 *  Revision 1.43  2004/03/15 06:10:35  dennis
 *  Removed unused import statements.
 *
 *  Revision 1.42  2004/03/15 03:28:04  dennis
 *  Moved view components, math and utils to new source tree
 *  gov.anl.ipns.*
 *
 *  Revision 1.41  2003/11/20 18:28:11  rmikk
 *  Added Documentation to Attribute Strings
 *
 *  Revision 1.40  2003/08/11 22:17:06  dennis
 *  Added T0_SHIFT attribute, to record shift in T0 from SCD
 *  calibration.
 *
 *  Revision 1.39  2003/02/19 21:55:49  dennis
 *  Added flags for attribute "level of detail"
 *
 *  Revision 1.38  2003/02/18 18:58:26  dennis
 *  Added SAMPLE_ORIENTATION attribute name.
 *
 *  Revision 1.37  2003/02/12 20:05:14  dennis
 *  Removed SEGMENT_INFO and SEGMENT_INFO_LIST.
 *  Added RAW_DISTANCE for TOF_DG_SPECTROMETERs.
 *
 *  Revision 1.36  2003/02/07 19:45:06  dennis
 *  Added DETECTOR_DATA_GRID
 *
 *  Revision 1.35  2003/02/07 19:05:51  dennis
 *  Added PIXEL_INFO_LIST String.
 *
 *  Revision 1.34  2003/01/15 20:54:25  dennis
 *  Changed to use SegmentInfo, SegInfoListAttribute, etc.
 *
 *  Revision 1.33  2002/12/20 20:24:59  pfpeterson
 *  Added a new static String for user name.
 *
 *  Revision 1.32  2002/12/04 14:53:22  pfpeterson
 *  Added string constants for the start date and start time.
 *
 *  Revision 1.31  2002/11/27 23:14:06  pfpeterson
 *  standardized header
 *
 *  Revision 1.30  2002/11/12 00:20:18  dennis
 *  Made immutable by:
 *  1. remove setValue() method
 *  2. add() & combine() methods now return a new Attribute
 *
 *  Also:
 *  3. Since it is now immutable, clone() method is not needed and
 *     was removed
 *  4. Default constructor is now private, since the value can't
 *     be set from outside of the class
 *
 *  Revision 1.29  2002/09/25 16:49:17  pfpeterson
 *  Added string constants for SCD calibration information.

 *  own version handling.
 *  Added readObject() method to handle reading of different
 *  versions of serialized object.
 *  Added NeXus string constant names for analysis types.
 *  Removed redundant "transient" qualifier from static field.
 *
 *  Revision 1.25  2002/07/10 20:57:52  pfpeterson
 *  All string constants are now transient and finally define the
 *  serialVersionUID=1L (the first version when we are counting).
 *
 *  Revision 1.24  2002/07/10 16:00:44  pfpeterson
 *  Added new string constants for GSAS handling.
 *
 *  Revision 1.23  2002/06/05 20:26:35  dennis
 *  Now implements the IXmlIO interface using "stubs" that just return false
 *  for the read and write methods.  These MUST be overidden in derived classes.
 *  Also, now includes a maximum label length that is used when concatenating
 *  label attributes.
 *
 *  Revision 1.22  2002/06/05 13:47:14  dennis
 *  Made "name" a protected field rather than private, since the name
 *  will have to be read/written to XML files by subclasses.
 *
 *  Revision 1.21  2002/03/28 19:34:39  pfpeterson
 *  Added new string constant for TIME_OFFSET attribute.

 *
 *  Revision 1.18  2002/02/25 14:25:51  dennis
 *  Un-commented "constant" names for LABEL, SEGMENT_IDS, CRATE, SLOT, etc.
 *
 *  Revision 1.17  2002/02/04 22:59:41  dennis
 *  Temporarily added strings for Sample Chi, Phi and Omega for SCD.
 *  These are currently commented out.
 *
 *  Revision 1.16  2001/12/21 17:29:33  dennis
 *  Added attribute for Segment IDS.  This is currently commented
 *  out to avoud breaking the server<->client communication.
 *
 *  Revision 1.15  2001/12/14 22:19:19  dennis
 *  Added attributes for LABEL and nominal and actual SOURCE_TO_SAMPLE_TOF.
 *  These attributes are currently commented out to avoid breaking the
 *  server<->client communication.
