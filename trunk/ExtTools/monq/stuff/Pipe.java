/**
  <p>implements a threadable pipe. The idea of this class is to collect
  information from an input stream in an asynchronous fashion, or send
  output to a stream asynchronously.</p>

  <p>After setting up the <code>Pipe</code> with an input and an output
  stream, it is usually run with something along the lines of
  * <pre>
  * new Thread(pipe).start()
  * </pre>
  As long as input is available from the input stream, the thread will
  copy it to the output stream.
  
  <p>Typical use of this class would be to collect standard input and
  standard error of a subprocess.
