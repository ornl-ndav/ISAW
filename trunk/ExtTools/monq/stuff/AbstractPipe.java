/**
 * <p>a skeleton implementation of a combination of {@link Feeder}
 * and {@link Drainer}. Subclasses only need
 * to implement {@link #pipe}.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class implements the <code>run()</code> method required by
 * the <code>Feeder</code> and <code>Drainer</code> interfaces. It
 * calls <code>pipe()</code>, catches any exceptions thrown and closes
 * the provided streams as requested by the 2nd
 * parameters of {@link #setOut setOut()} and {@link #setIn setIn()}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Objects of this class may be reused within a <em>single</em>
 * thread as long as <code>setIn()</code> and/or <code>setOut()</code>
 * are called as necessary before each invocation of the
 * <code>run()</code> method.</p>
 *
 * <h3><em>Half</em> Subclasses</h3>
 *
 * <p>A subclass need not make use of both, input and output. If it
 * generates data, it can choose to only use the output stream
 * provided by {@link #setOut setOut()}, thereby actually being a
 * {@link Feeder} only. A pure data sink, i.e. a {@link Drainer},
 * results if only the provided input stream is used.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Of course such subclasses should then only be used as either
 * <code>Feeder</code> or <code>Drainer</code> such that the unused
 * stream is never set anyway.</p>
