 * <code>Feeder</code> must deliver the data,</li>

 * to actually deliver the data,</li>
 *
 * <li>the <code>Feeder</code> closes the <code>OutputStream</code>
 * set with <code>setOut</code> depening on the second parameter of
 * <code>setOut</code> before <code>run()</code> terminates.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Hint:</b> A <code>Feeder</code> can be easily implemented by
 * subclassing {@link AbstractPipe}.</p>
