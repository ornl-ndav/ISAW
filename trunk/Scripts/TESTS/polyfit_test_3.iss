# Demo script to fit polynomial of degree 4 to a double peak in a spectrum.
# This is probably NOT a good idea, but it does show that the polynomial 
# fitting routines work reasonably.  The result is a DataSet with two spectra
# with Group ID 54.  One has the complete raw data for Group ID 54, the other
# has the rightmost double peak replaced by a polynomial of degree 4. Zoom in on
# the image of the rightmost double peak of both spectra to see this better.
